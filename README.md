# TraderOS

**Research-first operating system for systematic traders.** Ingest market data,
transform it into analyzable structure, run hypothesis-driven research,
execute strategies under disciplined risk management, record every outcome as
evidence, and grow a knowledge graph with every cycle.

This README is a **living product-state document**: it describes what the
product actually is today (verified against the code and the live deployment),
what it is capable of, what is genuinely proven, and what remains before real
capital may move. It is updated as part of every sprint.

## Current status (2026-08-22 — Sprints 41–45)

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Test suite | **2293 passed / 7 skipped / 100% line coverage** (gate `fail_under = 100`) | CI `test` job, `pytest --cov` |
| Static checks | ruff, black, isort, pyright (strict, 0 errors), pre-commit (10 hooks) | CI `lint` + `typecheck` jobs |
| CI pipeline | **Green end-to-end** (lint, typecheck, test, security, governance, version-check, evidence-drills, deploy-check, docker, **deploy**) | `gh run list` (Sprint 44) |
| Release | `v1.2.0` published: wheel + sdist + GitHub Release + GHCR image `ghcr.io/dmuhoro/traderos:1.2.0` | Sprint 40 |
| Live deployment | **EU region (`ams`)**, `https://traderos-production.up.railway.app` — auth boundary armed (fail-closed), paper mode, **real Binance feed live** (REST + WS), orchestrator + soak service online | Sprints 43–44, `railway status` |
| Real market data | **LIVE Binance REST + WebSocket feed proven end-to-end on the deployed instance** — daily-candle freshness delta + WS ticks; WS-resync reconciliation closes outage gaps against REST truth (VERDICT PASS) | `docs/evidence/2026-08-22_region_migration_feed_activation.log`, `2026-08-22_ws_resync_drill.log` |
| G-02 cloud soak | **Running**: dedicated `traderos-soak` Railway service, self-supervised hourly batches ×10 through the real Alpaca paper endpoint; batches 001–004 PASS (window ends ~2026-08-25T07:56Z) | `2026-08-22_operator_gates_soak_launch.log`, `railway logs --service traderos-soak` |
| Backups | `traderos db backup/restore` (SQLite + **Postgres** via `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`); **live Postgres backup→restore drill PASS** (schema v9, 35 tables round-trip intact) | `2026-08-22_postgres_backup_restore_drill.log` |
| Rate limiting | Broker rate limiter on by default; **burst/load-shedding drill 13/13 PASS** — broker + HTTP 429s with `Retry-After`/`X-RateLimit-*`, circuit breaker stays closed under load, traffic resumes | `2026-08-22_rate_limiter_burst_drill.log` |
| Evidence drills | 18 credential-free drills run as a CI gate; 8 key/network-gated drills operator-run | `docs/evidence/` (72 logs) |
| Governance | Constitution, ADRs, release constitution, live-run policy, operator acknowledgment, fail-closed live gate | Sprint 40 |
| Gated auto-deploy | Every `main` push runs full CI then **deploys production via Railway from CI** (project-scoped token, PATH fix proven) | Sprint 44, `2026-08-22_operator_gates_soak_launch.log` |
| Durable stores | Knowledge graph, research store, and backtest history now **durable** (SQLite + Postgres repos, migration v009) — no data lost on restart | Sprints 41–42 |

**Honest headline:** the engine is built, tested at 100% coverage, deployed
behind a verified fail-closed boundary, **now ingesting real Binance market
data on a live EU instance**, with the G-02 paper-broker soak **running** and
batches passing. The product has still **never placed a real order** — order
execution is deferred last per directive, and launch posture remains **NO-GO
for real capital** until the G-02 soak window, G-01 edge proof (data-validation-
only posture), and remaining operator gates in
`docs/engineering/GAP_READINESS.md` are empirically met.

---

## What the product does today

### Core loop (proven)
- **Signal → decision → order → fill → reconcile** causal chain, recorded to a
  durable, hash-chained audit trail; replay reconstructs per-strategy FIFO
  realized PnL bit-complete across restarts (`replay_service.py`).
- **Execution engine** with cost model (fee + slippage + latency), partial
  fills, forced-disconnect recovery, broker↔journal reconciliation, and
  intent-idempotent `client_order_id` dedupe on restart.

### Risk rails (proven fail-closed)
- Per-order notional + daily-loss gates, gross-exposure cap, position-size and
  max-position limits, symbol allowlist, and a **persistent kill switch** that
  flattens exactly-once through the real broker path. Production config refuses
  to arm without explicit rails (`resolve_risk_rails`, LIVE refuses boot).
- Data-gap breaker: stops trading on stale or missing data.
- Broker rate limiter on by default (opt-out is explicit); emergency flatten
  bypasses throttle but stays under the circuit breaker and journaled.
- **Load-shedding is explicit, never a crash**: rate-limit rejections carry a
  clear reason, are swallowed by the cycle/daemon handlers (the process keeps
  running), and do **not** trip the broker circuit breaker — the HTTP layer
  returns 429 with `Retry-After` + `X-RateLimit-*`, and legitimate traffic
  resumes once the window closes (proven by the burst drill).

### Data
- **Mock collector** (deterministic, default) for offline CI/tests.
- **Binance REST collector** (`binance_collector.py`) and **Binance WebSocket
  streaming feed** aggregated into candles (`streaming_collector.py`) — both
  present and tested, **live on the deployed EU instance** (REST + WS proven;
  `BINANCE_ENABLED`/`BINANCE_STREAMING` env switches, committed default off for CI).
- **WS-resync reconciliation** (`streaming_collector.py`): after any reconnect,
  the live cache is reconciled against Binance REST klines — interior gaps
  filled, divergent candles replaced beyond a 5 bps tolerance, with a
  rate-limited mop-up pass that verifies the damaged candle once its official
  kline matures. Proven live: 3 forced outages → 2 resyncs → gapless,
  kline-matching convergence (VERDICT PASS).
- **Alpaca collector** for broker-market data; frozen Binance 1h snapshot
  committed for reproducible walk-forward evidence (network-free).

### Operator API (FastAPI, 55+ routes under `/v1`)
Workflow, portfolio, positions, orders, trades, equity curve, PnL, kill switch,
preflight, readiness, live/check, strategies (CRUD + lifecycle + compare +
clone), session reports, audit, metrics, manifest, SSE events, per-user
attribution replay, market overview, market candles/symbols, research
indicators/backtest/observations, retail register/login/logout/orders, and
operator auth login/logout.

### Operator dashboard (`/dashboard`)
Single-page static bundle (no build step) serving all panels above, with
**session-token login (username/password, `POST /v1/auth/login`) stored in
`sessionStorage` — never a roaming `localStorage` API key** (WP8), and a
single-use SSE token for the live event stream.

### Research (research lab)
`ResearchService` with observations / hypotheses / experiments / lessons,
indicator toolkit (SMA/EMA/RSI/ATR/Bollinger/Stochastics), and per-symbol
backtests against the live-ingested candle series.

### Security & operations
- Auth: role-scoped API keys (`admin`/`operator`/`viewer`, constant-time
  compare) **or** PBKDF2-backed session login; fail-closed boundary middleware;
  production boot refuses to serve without keys + TLS posture
  (`assert_production_policy`).
- HA: lease-based failover (stale-after-90s takeover, fail-closed standby).
- Secret management: HashiCorp Vault (KV-v2) provider on the live boot path,
  value-redacted access audit, rotation with reload; env fallback (paper).
- On-call: PagerDuty events/v2 + Slack webhook + generic webhook transports,
  env-gated, fail-closed construction; CRITICAL alerts on unclean death, kill
  trip, gap breach.
- Observability: Prometheus `/metrics`, health endpoints, run manifest,
  supervision with unclean-shutdown detection.
- Releases: HMAC-signed, operator-acked, CI-enforced version/tag gates.

### CLI (`traderos`)
`strategies`, `backtest`, `papertrade create|list`, `signal`, `daemon`, `run`,
`status`, `risk` (engage/disengage/reconcile), `metrics snapshot|watch`,
`validate`, `pilot readiness|dry-run`, `security audit`, `db migrate|check|
rollback|backup|restore`, `health`, `audit verify|query`, `notify`.

## Known gaps on the road to GO (honest)

Everything in this section is a **measured** gap — each is either closeable in
software, operator-run, or account-gated. The full register with scores and
exit tests lives in `docs/engineering/GAP_READINESS.md`.

### Closeable in software (this sprint work)
Sprint 41 closed the four previously-listed software gaps: `POST /v1/backtest`
is now **honest** (runs the engine on the real ingested candle series, fails
closed on unknown/empty symbol), the research store is **durable** (SQLite +
Postgres repos), list endpoints are **paginated** (`limit`/`offset`), and the
real Binance feed is **switchable on deploy** via env vars. Sprint 42 added
the durable knowledge graph, migration v009, and persisted backtest history.
Sprint 45 proved WS-resync reconciliation live. Remaining software-closeable
work is tracked in the sprint docs; the genuinely open items are below.

### Operator-run (need credentials/time, harness ready)
1. **72h G-02 paper-broker soak — RUNNING** (`run_unattended_paper_soak.py`,
   dedicated `traderos-soak` Railway service, hourly batches ×10 cycles through
   the real chain). Started 2026-08-22T07:56Z; **batches 001–004 PASS**; final
   PASS requires every batch green through ~2026-08-25T07:56Z.
2. **Managed Vault/KMS rotation cadence** — proven against local Vault only.
3. **Live on-call delivery** — transports proven on the wire in drills; no
   real PagerDuty/Slack account has received a live incident.
4. **Orphaned Postgres volume** — the Amsterdam migration left
   `postgres-volume` (84 MB) detached and unused alongside the active
   `postgres-volume-tZfp`; data survives on the attached volume (backup/restore
   drill PASS), but the orphan should be deleted by an operator to avoid a
   wrong-volume mount in an incident. Surfaced in
   `2026-08-22_postgres_backup_restore_drill.log`.

### Account-gated (deferred last, per directive)
5. **Real order execution** — real Alpaca connectivity proven once (read-only);
   **no real order has ever been submitted or filled**. Tested last, after all
   software and operator gates are green.
6. **A cost-adjusted edge, or an explicit data-validation-only posture** —
   walk-forward shows no positive expectancy after full costs on out-of-sample
   data; the launch claim must be decided honestly before real capital.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install
pip install -e ".[all,dev]"

# Configure (copy and edit)
cp .env.example .env

# Run tests (full suite + 100% coverage gate)
make test

# Run the API server (paper mode; auth open only if no keys configured)
traderos-api

# Run the trading daemon
traderos daemon start
```

### Operator auth (production)

Set role keys (or bootstrap an operator account for session login) before
deploying:

```bash
export TRADEROS_ADMIN_API_KEY='<long-random>'
export TRADEROS_OPERATOR_API_KEY='<long-random>'
export TRADEROS_VIEWER_API_KEY='<long-random>'
export TRADEROS_ENV=production
export TLS_TERMINATED_BY_PROXY=true
export TRADING_MODE=paper
```

The API **refuses to boot** in production without keys + a TLS posture
(fail-closed). For the session-login flow: set `TRADEROS_ADMIN_USERNAME` /
`TRADEROS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` on first boot to seed the operator account.

## Common operations

```bash
# Paper trading
traderos papertrade create          # start a paper session
traderos papertrade list            # list sessions

# Backtesting (honest: uses real ingested candles via research endpoint)
curl -X POST localhost:8000/v1/research/backtest \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"strategy": "moving_average_trend", "symbol": "BTCUSDT"}'

# Operator login (session token, not an API key)
curl -X POST localhost:8000/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username": "...", "password": "..."}'

# Dashboard
open http://localhost:8000/dashboard
```

### Migrations (v001–v009)

`v001_initial`, `v002_observability`, `v003_strategies`, `v004_external_order_id`,
`v005_order_event_journal`, `v006_operator_surface`, `v007_historical_candles`,
`v008_user_accounts`, `v009_research_knowledge` (canonical research + knowledge
tables). Backend: SQLite (dev/test), Postgres (production), in-memory (tests).
Research store, knowledge graph, and backtest history are durable on SQLite and
Postgres — not lost on restart.

## Key environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `TRADING_MODE` | `paper` | `paper` \| `live` \| `backtest` |
| `TRADEROS_ENV` | `development` | `production` arms the sealed security policy |
| `DB_PATH` | `data/trader.db` | SQLite path (or `DATABASE_URL` for Postgres) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | Postgres connection (production store) |
| `DEFAULT_CASH` | `10000.0` | Paper/backtest starting capital |
| `TRADEROS_ADMIN/OPERATOR/VIEWER_API_KEY` | — | Role-scoped API keys (fail-closed in production) |
| `TRADEROS_ADMIN_USERNAME/PASSWORD` | — | Seeds the operator session-login account |
| `TLS_TERMINATED_BY_PROXY` | — | `true` when a PaaS edge (Railway) serves HTTPS |
| `TRADING_MODE` + `data_collection.binance.enabled/streaming` | off | Enable the real Binance feed (see Gaps) |
| `BINANCE_ENABLED` / `BINANCE_STREAMING` | off | Env-var override for the real Binance feed (Railway-friendly) |
| `ALPACA_API_KEY` / `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` | — | Broker keys (paper or live; prefer Vault in live) |
| `WEBHOOK_URL` / `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` / `PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY` | — | On-call transport wiring |
| `RISK_*` | — | Override risk rails; LIVE refuses to arm without them |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | — | Allowed browser origins for the dashboard API |

Secrets live in env or the secret manager — **never in `settings.yaml`, never
committed**. Paper keys exist only in-process for drills and should be rotated.

## Evidence & verification culture

Every sprint ships with committed evidence under `docs/evidence/` (67 logs).
Drills are genuine: they exercise the real code paths (submission seam,
journal, reconciliation, risk rails, governance gate) and either record a
`VERDICT: PASS` with a measurable condition or return a non-zero exit — no
simulated `PASS`. The 18 credential-free drills run as a CI gate
(`evidence-drills` job) so a regression fails the build.

Key documents:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `docs/engineering/GAP_READINESS.md` | Gap register with scores, risk, exit tests, GO/NO-GO definition |
| `docs/engineering/CONSTITUTION.md` | Engineering constitution (authoritative rules) |
| `docs/engineering/LIVE_RUN_POLICY.md` | Red-lines, kill authority, pilot terms for real capital |
| `docs/engineering/OPERATIONAL_TRUST_REPORT.md` | Operational-trust closure record |
| `docs/runbooks/PILOT_READINESS.md` | Readiness gate + go/no-go for live |
| `docs/runbooks/CONTROLLED_PILOT.md` | Bounded, supervised pilot terms |
| `docs/runbooks/RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` | Deploy + on-call + rollback runbook |
| `docs/sprints/SPRINT_*.md` | Chronological sprint records |
