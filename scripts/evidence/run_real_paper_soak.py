"""G-02 evidence: unattended paper-broker soak HARNESS (real Alpaca paper).

The G-02 exit test is an *unattended paper-broker soak (Alpaca paper,
24–72h)*: 0 reconcile errors, 0 duplicate/lost orders across forced
disconnects, journal-recovery replays correctly.

This is the operator-run harness for that soak. It requires live **paper**
Alpaca credentials in the environment (ALPACA_API_KEY / ALPACA_SECRET_KEY —
never committed; env-only per LIVE_RUN_POLICY §credential policy). Without
credentials it fails closed: it refuses to invent broker truth, so the honest
result is NO-GO (soak cannot run), exactly like ``run_cost_adjusted_backtest``.

It drives the real production chain (CycleExecutor -> JournaledBroker ->
AlpacaBrokerAdapter) for ``cycles`` market orders against the real Alpaca
paper endpoint, then reconciles broker truth against the journal + local
position book.

CLOSE-OUT IS ORDERS *AND* POSITIONS. Each batch closes out what it opened:
its own resting orders (cancel) and its own net position delta (market close),
so a multi-day run cannot walk the account into a holding until buying power
is exhausted and every later order is rejected. Only the delta versus the
batch's own pre-run baseline is closed — a pre-existing holding is never
touched — and reconciliation is therefore run against that captured baseline:
the assertion is "broker truth ends where this run found it", not "the
account happens to be empty".
