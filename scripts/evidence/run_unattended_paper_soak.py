"""G-02 evidence: UNATTENDED real Alpaca paper-broker soak runner (24–72h).

The G-02 exit test is an *unattended paper-broker soak (Alpaca paper,
24–72h)*: 0 reconcile errors, 0 duplicate/lost orders across forced
disconnects, journal-recovery replays correctly.

This runner supervises that soak over a wall-clock window by repeatedly
invoking the verified real-path harness (``run_underlying_paper_soak`` works
on the same machine; see run_real_paper_soak.py / run_unattended_paper_soak.py)
in bounded batches. Each batch:

  - places ``--batch-cycles`` market orders through the real production chain
    (CycleExecutor -> JournaledBroker -> AlpacaBrokerAdapter -> real Alpaca
    paper endpoint),
  - writes its own dated evidence log (never overwriting a prior batch),
  - closes out its own residue (0 leaked orders; a user's are never touched),
  - reconcile must come back clean for the batch to count as PASS.

This wrapper appends one atomic row per batch to an aggregate evidence log,
and at the end of the window returns PASS only if every batch passed. It is
self-supervised: a crashed/absent batch is recorded as FAIL, never silently
dropped (AGENTS rule: no silent drops). It requires real paper credentials in
the environment and otherwise exits NO-GO (like the harness).

RESTART / RESUME (the 72h Railway soak). The window is checkpointed to
``docs/evidence/<label>_soak_state.json`` — on the persistent volume, so it
survives the container restart the supervisor performs on failure. A restart
CONTINUES the window from the checkpoint's accumulated elapsed time; it does not
start a fresh 72h clock. Without this, every restart reset the wall-clock
deadline and the soak could never complete: the service exhausted its retries
and went CRASHED with no verdict. A checkpoint whose geometry (window, batch
size, interval, label) differs is set aside as ``.superseded`` and a fresh
window begins, so two different experiments are never spliced into one verdict.
A window already marked ``completed`` is not re-run.

Run (env-only paper keys; unattended window in hours):

    PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/evidence/run_unattended_paper_soak.py \
