# TraderOS — Strategic Completion Blueprint

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-07-31
**Author:** Strategic Codebase Audit (engineering intelligence mission)
**Basis:** Full repository audit of 136 source modules, 68 test files, 4 sprints, 4 ADRs, CI/CD, deployment configs, and two independent trust reports.

---

## 0. Executive Summary — The Single Question

> **"If TraderOS were to become a truly production-complete, operationally trusted, commercially valuable trading platform, what is the shortest execution path from today to that state?"**

**Answer:** TraderOS is an **engineering-complete, operationally-unproven, commercially-empty** codebase. The engineering core is genuinely strong — 84% coverage, 832 passing tests, SHA-256 tamper-evident audit chain, manual-reset circuit breaker, preflight go/no-go gate, dependency-direction enforcement, pyright-strict typing, and a clean CI with security jobs. But the operational trust report scores production readiness at **22/100** ("Do not approve for controlled live pilot"), and there is **no user-facing product at all**.

The shortest path is **three compressed programmes, not eleven sprints**:

1. **Programme A — Core Loop Integrity (~4 weeks).** Make the single trading cycle actually correct end-to-end: fix the position-bookkeeping bug, the position-sizing unit bug, the dead kill-switch loss tracking, the non-firing strategies, and the double-preflight. Wire the orphaned analysis layer (regime/breakout/liquidity detection) into the cycle. This is the highest-leverage work in the entire repository: every other programme depends on a correct core loop, and its defects silently violate the Constitution's risk principles today.

2. **Programme B — Operational Trust (~5 weeks).** Resolve all 11 OT findings: live Binance WebSocket transport, durable idempotency + replay, transactional order-event side effects, tick validation, the broken PostgreSQL migration path, API health boundedness, serialized order events, and concurrency safety. Deliverable: a verifiable controlled-pilot deployment that raises the Production Readiness Index from 22 to **70+**.

3. **Programme C — Commercial Surface (~3 weeks).** Build the minimum customer-usable surface: a real-time web dashboard (positions, P&L, orders, kill-switch), one-click paper→live mode with forced confirmation, and a documented user journey. Until this exists, the product has **zero commercial value** regardless of engineering quality.

**Total: ~12 weeks to a production-complete, operationally-trusted, commercially-usable trading platform.** Everything else in this document is decomposition of these three programmes.

## 1. Capability Classification — All Layers

Legend: **C** = COMPLETE, **V** = COMPLETE BUT NEEDS VERIFICATION, **P** = PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED, **M** = MISSING, **O** = OBSOLETE, **D** = DUPLICATED

| # | Layer | Capability | State | Evidence |

## 2. Everything Already Finished

These are durable assets. **Do not rebuild them. Do not refactor them for their own sake.**

- **Audit integrity (all 3 backends)** — SHA-256 canonical serialization, content-integrity `verify_chain()`, 6-field mutation tests, multi-seed PYTHONHASHSEED determinism.
- **Broker state reconciliation** — 10-mismatch detection engine, KillSwitch wiring, 10×6 effect matrix (~63 assertions), TOCTOU-protected preflight.
- **Preflight go/no-go gate** — audit-chain + reconciliation freshness + kill-switch + live-confirmation, wired into factory and cycle.
- **Risk primitives** — manual-reset circuit breaker (ADR-007), consecutive-failure kill switch, WP-7.1 verification suite.
- **Domain entity model** — rigorous `Trade` state machine, value objects, position/signal/market/candle entities.
- **Architecture enforcement** — AST dependency-direction checker with committed breaking fixture.
- **SQLite persistence** — 17 repositories, 4 migrations, backup/restore with rotation, WAL + busy_timeout.
- **Observability services** — audit/health/metrics/manifest across InMemory/SQLite/Postgres; Prometheus `/metrics`; JSON structured logging.
- **Backup/restore** — SQLite gzip + `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`, CLI commands, timed SLO tests, operational-recovery drills.
- **CI/CD** — 5-job pipeline (lint, typecheck, test+coverage, pip-audit+bandit, docker push to GHCR).
- **Test infrastructure** — 832 passing tests at 84% coverage; architecture + integration + performance suites; 10-hook pre-commit.
- **Detection service logic** — regime/breakout/sweep/swing/liquidity/session-analysis algorithms all implemented and unit-tested (they just aren't wired).
- **Governance** — Constitution, MEP, 4 ADRs, operations runbooks, controlled-pilot parameters.

**Bottom line:** ~80% of the *engineering intellectual capital* is done and solid. The remaining work is **wiring, correctness, operational proof, and commercial surface** — not invention.

## 3. Everything Duplicated

| # | Duplication | Locations | Cost / Risk |
|---|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| D1 | Kill-switch | `RiskService` (risk_service.py) + `PersistentKillSwitch` (reconciliation_service.py) | Two sources of truth for circuit-open state |
| D2 | Research engine | `ResearchService` (repo-based) + `ResearchEngine` (raw-SQL in domain/research/) | Same workflow twice; both unwired |
| D3 | Broker contract | `BrokerAdapter` ABC + `BrokerPort` Protocol | Dead protocol; two contracts to keep in sync |
| D4 | Metrics implementation | 4 × (`MetricsService`, SQLite, Postgres, Prometheus) | Same `TimingContext` copy-pasted 4× |
| D5 | Market-data store | legacy `market_data` table (pandas) vs `candles` table (repo) | Two stores never reconciled |
| D6 | Pub/sub | `InMemoryEventBus` (events.py) + `InMemoryMessageQueue` (message_queue.py) | Two event systems |
| D7 | Strategy storage | `strategies` table + `strategy_registry` table + in-memory registry | Triplicated; split-brain |
| D8 | Notifications | `NotifierPort`→`WebhookNotifier` vs `NotificationService` built-in channels | Two delivery paths |
| D9 | Correlation | `CorrelationService.compute_correlation` + `DeviationAnalysisService.compute_corridor` | Same math twice |
| D10 | Max-drawdown | `BacktestingService.compute_metrics` + `RiskService.compute_max_drawdown` | Same math twice |
| D11 | Inline SMA/ATR | `BacktestingService.run` re-implements `AnalysisService` | Indicator drift risk |
| D12 | Trade pipeline | `CycleExecutor.run` + `PaperTradingService.process_candle` | Signal→risk→size→place duplicated |
| D13 | Doc trees | `docs/adr/` vs `docs/decisions/`, `docs/sprints/` vs `sprints/`, `runbooks/` vs `docs/runbooks/` | Confusion; stale copies |

**Consolidation rule:** do NOT build "one true implementation" by abstraction surgery. Kill the dead side (the one with zero production references) and keep the live side. Only D1, D4, and D7 are worth active consolidation (they touch production paths).

---

## 4. Everything Obsolete

| # | Module | Why obsolete |
|---|--------|--------------|
| O1 | `infrastructure/collectors/yfinance_collector.py` | `fetch_historical()` always returns `[]`; never registered |
| O2 | `infrastructure/database/db_manager.py` (`DatabaseManager`) | Legacy pandas persistence; only test consumers; superseded by repos |
| O3 | `domain/research/research_engine.py` | Superseded by repo-based `ResearchService`; test-only |
| O4 | `infrastructure/data/` | Empty package (dead directory) |
| O5 | `infrastructure/visualization.py` | Test-only; matplotlib exports are not a product surface |
| O6 | `BrokerPort` Protocol | Dead duplicate of `BrokerAdapter` ABC |
| O7 | `EventBus = EventBusPort` alias | Backward-compat cruft |
| O8 | `MarketHoursEngine` | Dead stub; `_is_market_hours()` always True, never called |
| O9 | `DaemonController._drain_open_orders()` | Empty body, never called |
| O10 | `infrastructure/logging/StructuredLogger` | Test-only; JSON formatter is the real logger |
| O11 | `configs/settings.yaml` branding | "Market Intelligence Platform v0.1.0" — stale identity |

**Action:** O1–O5, O6–O10 should be deleted or explicitly marked `# DEPRECATED`. This is pure simplification with zero risk (all are test-isolated).

---

## 5. Architectural Hot Spots

| # | Hot spot | Location | Consequence |
|---|----------|----------|-------------|
| H1 | **God method** — one 275-line method does data-fetch, indicators, strategy, preflight, risk, sizing, order, bookkeeping, metrics, events, notifications | `CycleExecutor.run()` | Every bug below traces to this. Untestable as a unit. |
| H2 | **God composition root** — 50+ imports, hardcoded knowledge of every infrastructure class, hand-written SQL dialect forks | `factory.py` | Wiring drift: 14 repos + 8 services never injected. |
| H3 | **Orchestrator god-dataclass** — 15+ concrete dependencies, manually constructs CycleExecutor/DaemonController | `orchestrator.py` | Duplicates composition; cannot be constructed by tests without 15 mocks. |
| H4 | **Kill-switch in the wrong module** — risk concept lives in reconciliation service | `reconciliation_service.py` | D1 root cause. |
| H5 | **Broker adapter in wrong layer** — `PaperBrokerAdapter` in domain/service, `AlpacaBrokerAdapter` in infrastructure | paper_trading_service.py, alpaca_broker.py | Layer ambiguity; two broker contracts. |
| H6 | **Migration/repo schema collision** — v001 creates 6 tables with column sets that differ from repo `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` | migrations/v001 vs sqlite repos | Latent runtime failure the moment repos are wired. |
| H7 | **PG migration path broken** — `conn.execute()` on psycopg2 connections (no such method); v004 ALTERs a table that doesn't exist yet | migration_manager.py | `DATABASE_URL` set → crash. Confirmed. |
| H8 | **Split-brain strategy storage** — 3 stores, 2 synced via raw SQL | factory._sync_strategy_registry | API/CLI/daemon can disagree on strategies. |
| H9 | **Startup purge without safety** — hard DELETE on 5 tables at every build, silent failures, no retention config | `_get_db` → `purge_old_entries` | Data loss risk in production. |

---

## 6. Production Blockers (verified)

Ordered by severity. **All of these must be resolved in Programme B.**

| # | Blocker | Evidence | Severity |
|---|---------|----------|----------|
| PB1 | **No live market transport** — `StreamTransport` is a protocol with zero implementations; no Binance WebSocket | OT-001 | Critical — release blocker |
| PB2 | **Durability of idempotency/replay** — `_seen_events` + `ReplayRecorder` in-memory; restart loses duplicate-fill protection | OT-002 | Critical — release blocker |
| PB3 | **Non-atomic order side effects** — trade mutated before persist; failure leaves state/stream/audit/portfolio inconsistent | OT-003 | Critical — release blocker |
| PB4 | **Invalid tick acceptance** — NaN/neg/zero/millisecond-vs-second timestamps accepted | OT-004 | Critical — release blocker |
| PB5 | **PostgreSQL migration path broken** — confirmed `conn.execute` AttributeError on psycopg2 | H7 (verified) | Critical — release blocker |
| PB6 | **API `/v1/health` stalls** — synchronous orchestrator build in request path, no timeout (reproduced 45s+) | OT-010 | High — release blocker |
| PB7 | **Concurrent order events race** — dedup + transition not serialized | OT-006 | High |
| PB8 | **Candle aggregation fragility** — out-of-order/shutdown; final candle never flushed | OT-007 | High |
| PB9 | **Unbounded memory** — `ReplayRecorder.records`, `_latencies` grow forever | OT-008 | High |
| PB10 | **`ACKNOWLEDGED` omitted from in-memory open-order query** — acked live orders treated as closed | OT-005 | High (already fixed in SQLite/domain? verify memory) |
| PB11 | **Alpaca modify path unverified** — `cancel_replace` semantic mismatch risk | OT-009 | High |
| PB12 | **docker-compose deploys two API instances, no daemon** — trading loop never deployed | Audit (verified) | High |
| PB13 | **Health endpoint + metrics timers bogus** — `cycle.duration` measures ~0ms; `cycles.completed` counts per-strategy | Audit (verified) | Medium |

---

## 7. Commercial Blockers

| # | Blocker | Impact | Effort to resolve |
|---|---------|--------|-------------------|
| CB1 | **No web UI / dashboard** | A customer has nothing to click; zero commercial surface | ~2-3 weeks (Programme C) |
| CB2 | **No onboarding / user accounts / multi-tenancy** | Cannot onboard any user safely | ~1 week (post-MVP) |
| CB3 | **No SDK / no programmatic consumer** | Cannot integrate into external tooling | ~1 week (post-MVP) |
| CB4 | **No paper→live upgrade path in UI** | Live mode gated only by env var; no product flow | Included in C |
| CB5 | **No reporting / performance analytics UI** | Backtest/equity results only via matplotlib PNGs | Included in C |
| CB6 | **No pricing / packaging / deployment story** | No SaaS model, no multi-tenant isolation | Deferred (post-trust) |

**Strategic truth:** the Commercial Readiness is 0% not because the product is far from done, but because **no product surface has been started**. It is the cheapest 3 weeks of value in the roadmap.

---

## 8. Verification Blockers

| # | Blocker | Effect |
|---|---------|--------|
| VB1 | **No live-credential verification** — no authenticated Binance/Alpaca test anywhere | Cannot claim live capability |
| VB2 | **PG repository tests absent** — 3 PG repos + migrations never tested | PG layer is speculative |
| VB3 | **No deployment verification** — Railway/nixpacks never deployed; health stalls | Deploy story unproven |
| VB4 | **Runbooks reference non-existent CLI commands** — cannot execute any drill | Operations docs are fiction |
| VB5 | **OT-010 health stall blocks full-suite CI runs** in some environments | CI reliability |
| VB6 | **Version/tag drift** — 1.0.0 vs 1.1.0 vs 0.3.0 | Release provenance unreliable |
| VB7 | **`black`/`isort` not enforced in CI** (only local `make ci`) | Formatting regressions slip through |

---

## 9. Operational Trust Blockers

| # | Blocker | Effect |
|---|---------|--------|
| TB1 | **No durable event journal** | Cannot reconstruct state after restart |
| TB2 | **No outbox/transaction boundary** | Cannot guarantee exactly-once portfolio effects |
| TB3 | **No production transport** | Cannot receive live data at all |
| TB4 | **No bounded health/readiness** | Cannot operate a reliable health-checked deployment |
| TB5 | **No concurrency serialization** | Cannot trust broker callbacks under load |
| TB6 | **No retention policy** | Memory/disk grow unboundedly |
| TB7 | **Secret rotation unwired** | Credentials cannot rotate without restart |
| TB8 | **Leader election unwired** | Multi-instance deployment is unsafe |

The Operational Trust Report's **22/100 PRI** is the single most important number in the repository. Programme B is a direct attack on it.

---

## 10. Unnecessary Abstractions

| # | Abstraction | Verdict |
|---|-------------|---------|
| A1 | `BrokerPort` Protocol (vs `BrokerAdapter` ABC) | Delete |
| A2 | `EventBus` alias | Delete |
| A3 | `DataNormalizer.normalize` (sort-only) | Inline/delete |
| A4 | Empty repo ABCs (`LiquidityZoneRepository: pass`, `StrategyEvaluationService`, `MarketDataPort` nominal) | Delete or wire |
| A5 | `StrategyEvaluationService` (never used; cycle uses global registry) | Delete or wire |
| A6 | 4× `TimingContext` | Consolidate to one |
| A7 | `InMemoryMessageQueue` (vs `InMemoryEventBus`) | Delete |
| A8 | `DatabaseManager` (legacy) | Delete |
| A9 | `RedisCache`/`RedisMessageQueue` (no Redis service exists anywhere) | Delete or wire |

**Rule of three:** if a thing has zero production references and only test references, it is dead weight. Delete it. The repo has ~40 modules in this state.

---

## 11. Opportunities to Simplify (highest-leverage first)

1. **Wire, don't abstract.** The detection/analysis/research layer is 90% implemented and 0% wired. The cheapest "new" feature in the repository is *connecting two existing components*.
2. **Delete the dead layer** (Section 4 + 10): removes ~40 modules, dozens of confusing tests, and lets coverage % rise mechanically.
3. **Make the runbooks true** (VB4): fix the CLI surface so documented commands exist — this turns "governance fiction" into "operational truth" with a weekend of work.
4. **One strategy store** (D7/H8): single source of truth for strategies.
5. **One broker contract** (D3/H5): delete `BrokerPort`, promote `BrokerAdapter`, move `PaperBrokerAdapter` into infrastructure.
6. **Unify market-data stores** (D5): `candles` table is the future; drop legacy `market_data` writes.

## 13. Production Readiness Matrix

| Pillar | Score | Evidence |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Deterministic logic + unit tests | 90% | 832 tests, 84% coverage |
| Static quality gates | 95% | ruff 0, pyright strict, pre-commit |

**Target after Programme B:** PRI ≥ 70.

---

## 14. Operational Trust Matrix

| Dimension | State | Trust |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Can receive live data | No (no transport) | Untrusted |
| Can survive restart | No (in-memory idempotency) | Untrusted |
| Can guarantee exactly-once effects | No (non-atomic) | Untrusted |
| Can reject malformed input | Partially | Low |
| Can run concurrent broker callbacks | No (unserialized) | Untrusted |
| Can deploy multi-instance safely | No (no leader election wiring) | Untrusted |
| Can rotate secrets | No (unwired) | Untrusted |
| Can execute ops runbooks | No (commands don't exist) | Untrusted |
| Can be monitored in prod | Partially (no dashboards/tracing) | Low |
| Can audit all state changes | Yes (audit chain) | High |
| Can reconcile broker truth | Yes (10-mismatch engine) | High |
| Can back up/restore | Yes (proven) | High |

**Trust posture:** "High-trust core primitives, untrusted live lifecycle." The audit/reconciliation/backup primitives are genuinely trustworthy; everything that touches a live exchange is not.

---

## 15. Commercial Readiness Matrix

| Dimension | State | Readiness |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| User-facing product | None | 0% |
| Onboarding | None | 0% |
| Accounts/multi-tenancy | None | 0% |
| SDK/API for consumers | REST-only, no trade endpoint | 10% |
| Reporting/dashboards | matplotlib PNGs | 5% |
| Live→paper upgrade path | env-var only | 10% |
| Pricing/deployment model | None | 0% |
| **Commercial Readiness Index** | **0/100** | Pre-product |

**Commercial truth:** TraderOS is currently a *platform engine*, not a *product*. That is fine for a research-first thesis, but it must be named honestly: everything so far is the engine; the product is entirely Programme C.

## 16. Pareto Analysis — The 20/80 Cut

The repository's remaining value is dominated by a handful of items. Ranked by combined leverage:

| Rank | Work item | % of remaining value |

| 1 | **Fix the core trading loop correctness** (positions, sizing, loss-tracking, strategies, double-preflight) | ~25% |
| 2 | **Resolve OT-001/002/003** (transport, durability, atomicity) — the three critical release blockers | ~25% |

## 18. Compressed Execution Programmes

**Do NOT preserve sprint structure.** Merge aggressively. Three programmes, strictly sequential, each with a hard Definition of Done that gates the next.

### Programme A — Core Loop Integrity
**Goal:** the single trading cycle is *correct* — every subsystem it touches does what its tests claim.
**Duration:** ~4 weeks | **PRI delta:** 22 → ~35 | **Blocker:** none (pure correctness)
**Status: COMPLETED 2026-07-31** — all A1 correctness defects closed (D1–D6, D8, D9; D7 reclassified by-design). Evidence: `docs/engineering/CORE_LOOP_TRUTH.md`, `docs/engineering/CORE_LOOP_EVIDENCE.md`. Machine truth: **843 tests passed, 84.63% coverage, ruff/pyright clean.**

| Work package | Tasks |
|--------------|-------|
| A1 — Loop correctness | Position bookkeeping; sizing unit; daily-loss wiring; strategy params; double-preflight; cycle metrics |
| A2 — Analysis layer wired | Regime/breakout/liquidity/session detection into the cycle; signal gating |
| A3 — Refactor for testability | Decompose `CycleExecutor.run()` into phase functions with per-phase tests |
| A4 — Hygiene sweep | Delete dead weight (Section 4+10); consolidate D1/D4/D7; unify strategy store; fix version drift; make runbooks true |

**Why it matters:** Every downstream programme builds on a correct core loop. Today the loop has verified correctness defects (positions never created, sizing in dollars, 2/3 strategies dead) that would corrupt live accounts. Fixing these is the highest-risk-reduction work available.

**Programme A outcome (2026-07-31):** defects fixed and pinned by 11 new invariant regression tests in `tests/test_core_loop_invariants.py` (I1/I2/I3/I5/I6/I8/I9 + D1–D6/D8/D9). Suite 832 → **843 passed**, coverage 84.42% → **84.63%**, ruff/pyright clean. Remaining Programme A backlog — A2 (wire analysis layer into the cycle), A3 (decompose `run()` into phase functions), A4 (hygiene sweep) — carries forward; note the Code Freeze scoped Programme A to *correctness only*, which is complete.
**Dependencies:** none. **Expected leverage:** unlocks B and C; +25 PRI-equivalent trust.

### Programme B — Operational Trust
**Goal:** PRI ≥ 70; controlled pilot approvable; PostgreSQL and API claims are true.
**Duration:** ~5 weeks | **PRI delta:** ~35 → 70+ | **Depends on:** A

| Work package | Tasks |
|--------------|-------|
| B1 — Live data path | Binance WebSocket transport (OT-001); tick validation (OT-004); candle robustness (OT-007); retention (OT-008) |
| B2 — Durable lifecycle | Durable idempotency + replay (OT-002); outbox/transactional side effects (OT-003); event serialization (OT-006); ACKNOWLEDGED open-order parity |
| B3 — Postgres + API truth | Fix migration path (PB5/H7); fresh-PG schema (H6); PG repo tests; API health boundedness (OT-010) |
| B4 — Deployment + verification | docker-compose daemon/PG stack; live-credential sandbox verification; controlled pilot run; Alpaca modify contract tests (OT-009) |

**Why it matters:** This is the entire difference between "22/100 — do not approve" and "production-complete, operationally trusted."
**Dependencies:** A (correct loop to operate), B1 before B2 (data first).
**Expected leverage:** +45 PRI; first credible live-mode claim.

### Programme C — Commercial Surface
**Goal:** a human being can sign in and run the platform.
**Duration:** ~3 weeks | **PRI delta:** 70 → 75 (ops) | **Depends on:** B
**Commercial Readiness delta:** 0 → ~60

| Work package | Tasks |
|--------------|-------|
| C1 — Dashboard MVP | Real-time positions/P&L/orders/kill-switch/health; WebSocket or SSE feed |
| C2 — Mode & onboarding | Paper→live flow with forced confirmation + audit trail; first-run onboarding |
| C3 — Reporting | Equity curve, drawdown, per-strategy performance from backtest/paper data |

**Why it matters:** without this the product has zero commercial value no matter how trustworthy the engine is.
**Dependencies:** B (won't demo a 22/100 engine).

### Post-MVP (not in the 12-week path)
SDK, multi-tenancy, RBAC, pricing/billing, alerting integrations, advanced reporting, hosted service.

## 19. Final Answer

> **Shortest execution path from today to production-complete, operationally-trusted, commercially-valuable TraderOS:**

1. **Programme A (4 weeks):** make the trading loop correct and wire the analysis layer. No external dependencies; highest risk-reduction per hour in the repo.
2. **Programme B (5 weeks):** defeat the 11 operational-trust findings — live transport, durable lifecycle, Postgres truth, bounded API, verifiable pilot. Raise PRI 22→70+.
3. **Programme C (3 weeks):** ship the dashboard, onboarding, and paper→live flow. Take Commercial Readiness from 0→60.

**~12 weeks total.** After that: an operating, trustworthy, demoable trading platform — and the entire long tail (SDK, tenants, billing, dashboards) becomes incremental work on a real product instead of finishing an incomplete one.

**One-line rule for the team:** *finish the loop, prove the loop, show the loop.* Nothing else moves the business needle.

## 20. Verification of Key Audit Claims

| Claim | Verified? |
|-------|-----------|
| PG migration path calls `conn.execute()` on psycopg2 (no such method) | ✅ `migration_manager.py:20,28,62,89,103` |
| Cycle executor never creates Position via `fill_trade()` | ✅ `cycle_executor.py:197-213` — `open_trade`/`update_trade` only |
| Sizing returns dollars used as qty | ✅ `portfolio_service.size_position` returns `cash*allocation` |
| docker-compose runs two API instances, no daemon | ✅ compose services `traderos` + `traderos-api` share entrypoint |
| 832 tests / 84% coverage | ✅ fixed by Programme A: **843 passed, 84.63%** (`python3 -m pytest -q -p no:randomly`); evidence in `CORE_LOOP_EVIDENCE.md` §4 |
| ruff clean | ✅ `ruff check src/traderos/` — All checks passed |
| OT-001…OT-011 | ✅ from OPERATIONAL_TRUST_REPORT (22/100) |
| No `modify_order` anywhere | ✅ grep across BrokerAdapter/Port/Alpaca/Paper/RateLimited |
| `StreamTransport` has no implementations | ✅ protocol-only in `market_stream.py` |
