# Sprint 40 — Release cut: version/record provenance, frozen-dataset discipline fix, drill-set promotion

**Period:** 2026-08-17
**Objective:** Take the repository from "feature-complete but drifting" to a
clean, releaseable state. Three concrete defects were closed without touching
the execution path: (1) the G17/VB6 version/tag drift — the changelog declared
a `1.1.0` release that had no matching git tag, and version sources disagreed
across files; (2) the real-market walk-forward drill silently re-fetched and
overwrote committed frozen market data on every run, destroying the
reproducibility anchor; (3) that same drill was mis-classified as a
network-gated drill despite running deterministically on committed data. All
work is evidence-verified and the release is cut as `v1.2.0`.

---

## 1. G17/VB6 version/tag drift closed (release provenance)

**Problem:** `CHANGELOG.md` listed `[1.1.0]` as released at commit `122f5bb`,
but no `v1.1.0` git tag exists locally or on origin (only `v1.0.0`). Version
sources also disagreed: `pyproject.toml` and `configs/settings.yaml` held
different values as recently as commit `122f5bb` (`1.1.0` vs `0.1.0`).

**Closure:**
- `pyproject.toml`, `configs/settings.yaml`, and
  `configs/settings.production.example.yaml` all now declare `1.2.0`.
- The CI version gate (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) asserts
  `pyproject.toml == settings.yaml` and that no legacy `VERSION` file is
  tracked — re-verified verbatim, PASS.
- The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) asserts the pushed
  tag equals the `pyproject.toml` version — verified against the back-fill
  plan: `v1.1.0` at commit `122f5bb` matches `1.1.0` in that commit's
  `pyproject.toml`.
- This release is cut as `v1.2.0`, matching both the working-tree version and
  the changelog header.

## 2. Frozen-dataset discipline fix

**Problem:** `scripts/evidence/run_real_market_walk_forward.py` documented
itself as running on frozen real data but on every invocation re-downloaded a
year of Binance klines and **overwrote the committed CSV** in
`docs/evidence/frozen/`. Fresh runs thus mutated committed evidence — the
reproducibility anchor drifted with every execution.

**Closure** (`scripts/evidence/run_real_market_walk_forward.py`):
- Default run reuses the newest committed frozen snapshot — zero network, bit
  deterministic (verified: identical fold results before/after across runs).
- `--refresh` writes a **new** dated snapshot and never mutates a committed
  one; the stale freeze anchor (`2026-08-06`) was git-removed and re-created
  under its honest content date `binance_btcusdt_1h_2026-08-17.csv`.
- Fail-closed: an unreadable/corrupt snapshot yields `VERDICT: NO-GO` and
  exit code 2; a failed download yields `NO-GO`, never fabricated data.
- `FROZEN_CSV` dead constant removed; snapshot discovery is by glob on the
  newest dated file.

## 3. Real-market walk-forward promoted into the deterministic CI drill set

**Problem:** `run_real_market_walk_forward.py` was listed in `KEY_GATED`
(credential/network-gated) in `scripts/evidence/run_ci_drills.py`, so it was
not part of the deterministic CI drill suite — despite running entirely on
committed data after the Section 2 fix.

**Closure:**
- Moved into `DRILLS` as `real_market_walk_forward`; the `KEY_GATED` comment
  and list updated to the true network-gated set (real-time streams,
  credentials, managed Postgres, unattended live soak).
- `tests/test_ci_drills_runner.py` inventory expectation updated to the new
  18-member set.
- Verified: `run_ci_drills.py` reports **18/18 PASS**.

## 4. Evidence drift verified and committed

All working-tree drift in `docs/evidence/` was inspected, not assumed: each
modified log carries a genuine `VERDICT: PASS` (or returns 0 via
`SystemExit(main())`), and the frozen CSV rename is a content-honest
re-anchoring. No `NO-GO` or `FAIL` record exists in the staged set.

## 5. Full verification (release gates)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `pytest -q` (full suite) | 2246 passed, 7 skipped, **100.00%** coverage (gate 100) |
| `ruff check .` | All checks passed |
| `black --check .` | 367 files left unchanged |
| `pyright` (strict, `src/traderos`) | 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| CI version gate (`pyproject.toml` vs `settings.yaml`) | PASS |
| CI drill suite | 18/18 PASS |

> Note: the local `pre-commit` `pyright` hook reports `reportMissingModuleSource`
> warnings for `psycopg2`/`requests` in unrelated infra files while running in
> its sealed hook env; CI and the Makefile `typecheck` run `pyright
> src/traderos/` against the fully-installed project and are clean. This is a
> hook-environment artifact, not a project gate, and is unchanged by this
> sprint.

## 6. CI pipeline made genuinely green (three pre-existing gate failures)

**Problem:** the GitHub Actions pipeline was **never green**. Every run back
to sprint-38 failed on three jobs that had nothing to do with the release cut:

| Job | Failure (every run) | Root cause |
|---|---|---|
| `test` | `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytz'` during collection | `alpaca-py` declares `pytz` only as a transitive requirement; a fresh CI resolution did not install it, so test collection broke on the alpaca import chain. |
| `governance` | `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scripts'` | `scripts/governance/live_gate.py` is executed as a bare script but imports `from scripts.governance.sign_release import ...` (package-relative). Only `src/` was added to `sys.path`, not the repo root, so `scripts` was unresolvable in the runner. |
| `security` | `traderos Dependency not found on PyPI and could not be audited: traderos (1.2.0)` | `pip-audit` attempts to audit the locally editable `traderos` package, which is not published to PyPI — a false failure on a first-party package. |

**Closure:**
- `pyproject.toml`: `pytz>=2020.1` made an explicit member of the `alpaca`
  extra (it is a hard runtime requirement of `alpaca-py==0.30.0`).
- `scripts/governance/live_gate.py`: repo root added to `sys.path` so the
  package-style `scripts.governance.*` imports resolve when the script is run
  as a file.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `pip-audit --skip-editable` — the audited
  surface is every real third-party dependency; the first-party package is
  covered by tests, not the PyPI advisory feed.
- Verified after the fixes: `pytest` 2246 passed / 7 skipped / 100% coverage,
  ruff, black, pyright, and `pre-commit` all green; `live_gate.py` exits 0 in
  paper mode and 1 (fail-closed) in live mode.

### Follow-up hardening on the first green run

The first all-green attempt surfaced two more environment-dependent gates that
had to be made deterministic, plus one real security finding:

- **Backup filename collision (real bug):** `_timestamp()` in
  `src/traderos/infrastructure/database/backup.py` used second resolution, so
  two backups in the same second silently overwrote each other — silent data
  loss. Now microsecond precision (`%Y%m%d_%H%M%S%f`), the same fix applied to
  frozen-snapshot naming in this sprint.
- **Environment-dependent coverage gate:** `_rotate_backups()` bound its
  default `max_count=MAX_BACKUPS` at import time, so the rotation test's
  `mod.MAX_BACKUPS = 2` had no effect — the rotation branch was only covered
  locally by accumulated state in the shared backup dir, never in CI. Default
  is now resolved at call time, and `restore_backup`'s SQLite branch got its
  own test (the Postgres branch was already covered). Coverage is genuinely
  100% in a clean environment.
- **Security finding:** CI's fresh `pip-audit` DB flagged
  `PYSEC-2026-2275` on `requests==2.32.4` (fix `2.33.0`); bumped to
  `requests==2.33.0`. (The local audit DB is stale and did not surface it —
  the CI finding is authoritative.)
- Re-verified with the fixes: **2246 passed, 7 skipped, 100.00% coverage**.

### Third gate: stale schema-version assertion in `deploy-check`

With every earlier job green, the `deploy-check` job finally executed and
failed on a **stale hard-coded expectation**: it greps `Schema version: 6` in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, but the migration set has advanced to **v008** —
the assertion was last correct when v006 was the newest migration, and was
silently rotting ever since (masked because prior jobs failed first). The
migration code and its tests were already correct
(`tests/test_migration_down_paths.py` asserts current version 8); only the
workflow's expectation was stale. Fixed to `Schema version: 8`, the true
latest migration. This is the same class of "gate that can rot while the real
path advances" defect this sprint was created to root out.

## 7. Governance / honesty notes

- As in SPRINT_39, the `0.2.12` npm-style bump reference is a stale
  transcription; the repo's real version scheme is the package version. The
  released `1.1.0` (changelog entry) is now back-filled as git tag `v1.1.0` at
  its release commit, and this sprint's work is cut as `v1.2.0` — every
  version source agrees and each tag will match its commit's `pyproject.toml`.
- The evidence refresh reflects new drill runs (timestamps 2026-08-17), all
  PASS. The single frozen-data snapshot is committed under an honest name.

## Verification closure
