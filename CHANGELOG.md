# Changelog - TraderOS

## [Unreleased]

### Sprint 41 (2026-08-20) — product completeness: honest backtest, durable research store, pagination, real-feed wiring

- **Deep audit + codebase index:** full inventory of `src/traderos` (190
  modules), the `/v1` API, migrations, and tests; corrected two stale claims
  in the readiness docs (operator login WP8 and market/research WP9 were
  already shipped).
- **Honest backtest:** `POST /v1/backtest` no longer fabricates synthetic
  candles — it runs the engine against the real ingested candle series and
  fails closed on unknown/empty symbol (404/503). Consumers get `symbol` and
  `candles` so a UI can never display fabricated-in-place numbers.
- **Durable research store:** research data (observations/hypotheses/
  experiments/results/lessons) was in-memory-only and lost on restart. Now
  wired to SQLite (was already implemented) and **new Postgres repos**
  (`postgres/research.py`) for production durability.
- **Pagination:** `limit`/`offset` added to `/v1/audit`, `/v1/manifest`,
  `/v1/trades`, `/v1/positions`, `/v1/orders`, `/v1/strategies`,
  `/v1/papertrade/sessions`; `RunManifest.get_runs` gained `offset`.
- **Real-feed wiring:** `BINANCE_ENABLED` / `BINANCE_STREAMING` env-var
  overrides switch the real Binance feed on for a deployed instance without
  editing committed YAML (committed default stays off for CI).
- **README rewritten** as a living product-state document (status, capabilities,
  honest gaps, env reference).
- `.env.example` refreshed with the full current variable set.
- Verification: new tests for backtest honesty, Postgres research repos (6),
  env-override (2), pagination offset; full suite green at 100% coverage.

### Sprint 42 (2026-08-20) — durability completion: knowledge graph, migration v009, persisted backtest history

- **Durable knowledge graph:** `KnowledgeGraphService` was in-memory-only and
  lost on restart. Now wired to SQLite (existed) + **new Postgres repos**
  (`postgres/knowledge.py`) for production durability — same gap closed for
  the research store in Sprint 41.
- **Migration v009:** added canonical `experiments`, `experiment_results`,
  `knowledge_nodes`, `knowledge_edges` tables for the Postgres store (the repos
  self-create them, but the migration set lacked them). Fresh Postgres now
  reaches schema version 9; all version assertions + CI `deploy-check` updated
  8 → 9.
- **Persisted backtest history:** `POST /v1/backtest` and
  `POST /v1/research/backtest` now record results via the strategy catalog;
  new `GET /v1/backtest/history?strategy=&limit=` surfaces them (404 on unknown
  strategy). Results were previously computed on the fly and never retained.
- **Real-feed deploy fix:** the `websockets` package shipped in no dependency
  group, so an explicitly-enabled Binance stream silently failed to wire in
  production images while healthz stayed green. New `streaming` extra +
  Dockerfile install; both factory streaming seams now log a loud warning on
  wire failure (no silent drops, tests pin both).
- **Honest deployment note:** the Railway production instance still serves no
  BTCUSDT candles — outbound Binance (REST + WSS) is unreachable from its
  egress region (local drill: 8/8 PASS on live feed). Activation needs a
  dashboard region move to an EU zone; see `docs/sprints/SPRINT_42.md`.
- Verification: 2268 passed / 7 skipped / 100% coverage, ruff/black/pyright/
  pre-commit clean.

### Sprint 43 (2026-08-22) — launch-prep infrastructure: EU region migration, gated auto-deploys, restart policy, live-feed activation

- **EU region migration:** prior dashboard snapshot-and-patch attempts had
  silently not taken effect (`region: sfo` / null). Completed the move via
  Railway's GraphQL API — `serviceInstanceUpdate` with explicit region config
  on both services, materialized by full-code deploys. **TraderOS + Postgres
  now co-located in `ams`**; co-location proven empirically (the app reaches
  the database over region-local `.internal` DNS).
- **Restart policy:** `ON_FAILURE` with 10 retries codified in `railway.toml`
  and applied to both service instances via API — a crashed container
  recovers into durable state instead of staying down.
- **Gated automated deploys:** new `deploy` CI job runs only after every
  quality gate (version-check, lint, typecheck, test, evidence-drills,
  security, docker, deploy-check, governance), only on pushes to `main`,
  deploys via Railway CLI + `RAILWAY_TOKEN`, and **skips loudly (green) when
  the token is absent** — no path deploys ungreen code; no silent skips.
- **Live-feed activation:** orchestrator started on the EU deployment; real
  BTCUSDT candles served through `/v1/market/candles` (HTTP 200) and **live
  WebSocket ticks proven** by an in-candle freshness delta (close moved
  77378.00 → 77293.34 and volume grew between reads 70 s apart).
- Evidence: `docs/evidence/2026-08-22_region_migration_feed_activation.log`
  (11 checks PASS); sprint record: `docs/sprints/SPRINT_43.md`.
- Honest residuals: G-02 soak start awaits operator-issued Alpaca paper keys;
  RAILWAY_TOKEN GitHub secret pending; one superseded FAILED redeploy row left
  in Railway history (documented in the sprint record).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-17

Ship-sprint release: the Railway deploy path is consolidated and elite-grade.

### Highlights
- **Deploy config consolidation (Ship 39):** `railway.json` / `nixpacks.toml`
  removed — `railway.toml` is the single source of deploy truth; `Dockerfile`
  hardened (`PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`, HEALTHCHECK on the real `/v1/healthz` wire).
- **Proxy-TLS production posture (Ship 39):** `TLS_TERMINATED_BY_PROXY=true`
  lets a PaaS-hosted app pass the sealed production security gate (TLS at the
  platform edge); fail-closed boot without it — proven both ways in the image.
- **Production config template (G-03):** `configs/settings.production.example.yaml`
  with armed conservative risk rails + allowlist.
- **Railway deploy runbook (G-04):** `docs/runbooks/RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` —
  env matrix, deploy, verify, on-call, rotation, rollback.
- **Frozen dataset discipline fix (this release):** the real-market walk-forward
  drill now reuses the committed frozen Binance dataset instead of re-fetching
  and overwriting committed data every run (`--refresh` to re-freeze) — the
  reproducibility anchor is stable.
- **Evidence:** paper soak 2500 cycles / 500 forced ack-drops PASS (0 dup/lost,
  restart-safe, reconcile clean); walk-forward honest verdict on real OOS.
- **Verification:** 2245+ tests at 100% coverage, ruff + pyright (+ pre-commit)
  green, CI drill suite green.
- **Release provenance fixed (G17/VB6):** `v1.1.0` release tag back-filled at
  its release commit; this release cut as `v1.2.0` aligned to `pyproject.toml`.

### Sprint 40 (release cut: version/tag provenance, frozen-dataset discipline, drill-set promotion)

- Single version source enforced: `pyproject.toml`, `configs/settings.yaml`
  and `configs/settings.production.example.yaml` all pinned to `1.2.0`; CI
  version gate re-verified (pyproject == settings, no tracked `VERSION`).
- `v1.1.0` release tag back-filled at its changelog release commit (`122f5bb`);
  this release cut as `v1.2.0` — both tags match `pyproject.toml` at their
  commits (G17/VB6 release-provenance gap closed).
- Real-market walk-forward drill (`scripts/evidence/run_real_market_walk_forward.py`)
  no longer re-fetches/overwrites committed market data: it reuses the newest
  committed frozen snapshot by default (network-free, bit-deterministic), and
  `--refresh` writes a NEW dated snapshot instead of mutating a committed one.
  Corrupt/missing data fails closed (`VERDICT: NO-GO`, exit 2), never
  fabricates.
- Frozen snapshot re-anchored to its honest content date:
  `docs/evidence/frozen/binance_btcusdt_1h_2026-08-17.csv` (git-rename).
- Real-market walk-forward promoted from the key-gated set into the
  deterministic CI drill suite (`run_ci_drills.py`): **18/18 credential-free
  drills PASS**; inventory test aligned.
- **CI pipeline made genuinely green:** three pre-existing gate failures that
  broke every pipeline run back to sprint-38 were fixed — (1) `pytz>=2020.1`
  made an explicit `alpaca` extra dependency (transitive-only resolution was
  unreliable in fresh CI envs), (2) `scripts/governance/live_gate.py` repo-root
  added to `sys.path` so package-style `scripts.governance.*` imports resolve
  when run as a file, (3) `pip-audit --skip-editable` so the first-party
  (non-PyPI) `traderos` package no longer trips the advisory audit. All three
  jobs now pass end-to-end.
- **Backup collision bug fixed:** backup filenames were second-resolution, so
  two backups in the same second silently overwrote one another — now
  microsecond-precision, no silent data loss.
- **Coverage gate made environment-independent:** `_rotate_backups()` default
  resolved at call time (was bound at import, so the rotation branch was only
  covered by accumulated local state); SQLite restore branch added its own
  test. 100% coverage now holds in a clean environment.
- **Security:** `requests` bumped `2.32.4` → `2.33.0` to clear
  PYSEC-2026-2275 surfaced by CI's fresh audit DB.
- **Stale deploy-check assertion fixed:** the migration smoke test grepped for
  `Schema version: 6` while the migration set has reached v008 — the gate
  rotted silently (masked by earlier failing jobs). Now asserts the true latest
  version (8); migration code/tests were already correct.
- **Flaky signal test fixed:** the paper-trading test built signals with two
  separate `now()` calls for `generated_at`/`expires_at`; when the clock did
  not tick between them the production invariant (expiry strictly after
  generation) correctly raised. Expiry now derives from `generated_at +
  timedelta` — stable across 30 repeated runs.
- **Live deployment armed (Ship 40):** the Railway production service was
  running with no production posture (`TRADEROS_ENV` unset → development mode,
  open auth boundary returning 200 on protected routes). Set the sealed
  posture variables, redeployed, and verified the fail-closed boundary on the
  live URL: unauth 401, all role keys 200, wrong key 401, health/metrics 200.
  Deployment `cb392f61` SUCCESS at
  `https://traderos-production.up.railway.app`.

### Sprint 39 (Railway shipping path: deploy config consolidation, proxy-TLS posture, deploy runbook)

### Deployment (G-04)
- `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml` removed — `railway.toml` is the single
  source of deploy truth (previously three descriptors with divergent
  behavior: two health-check paths and a Nixpacks path bypassing the
  Dockerfile).
- `Dockerfile` — `ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` (failures reach the platform log
  stream) and the HEALTHCHECK now curls the real HTTP liveness route
  `/v1/healthz` (same wire Railway polls).

### Production posture
- `infrastructure/security_policy.py` — proxy-TLS production posture:
  `TLS_TERMINATED_BY_PROXY=true` marks TLS as held at the trusted platform
  edge (the PaaS standard), so a `TRADEROS_ENV=production` boot on Railway
  can pass the security policy without app-level certs. TLS is satisfied by
  either self-terminated certs or the declared platform edge; production
  never assumes the edge. Finding detail names the mechanism.
- `tests/test_security_policy.py` +3 (18/18) — proxy flag and env-var
  propagation.
- Proven in the built image both ways: proxy-flagged production boots healthy
  with the auth boundary fail-closed (401/200/401); production without the
  flag refuses to boot (`SecurityPolicyError: tls: TLS not configured`).

### Configuration (G-03)
- `configs/settings.production.example.yaml` — armed conservative risk rails
  with `require_allowlist: true` and a non-empty `allowed_markets`, persistent
  `/app/data` DB path, secrets kept out of YAML.

### Runbook (G-04)
- `docs/runbooks/RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` — production env matrix, deploy steps,
  verification curls (liveness, auth-boundary 401, authenticated 200,
  metrics), honest smoke-test limits, on-call basics, secret rotation, and
  rollback.

### Ship-gate evidence
- Paper soak ×10 (2500 cycles, 500 forced ack-drops through the real
  CycleExecutor → JournaledBroker → AlpacaBrokerAdapter chain): PASS — 0
  duplicate/lost orders, restart re-submits nothing, reconcile clean.
  `docs/evidence/2026-08-17_sprint39_paper_soak_10x.log`.
- Walk-forward re-run on the frozen oracle (35% withheld OOS, full costs):
  honest outcome unchanged — no strategy shows positive expectancy after
  costs on OOS; pilot stays DATA-VALIDATION ONLY (no PnL claim).
- Full verification green: 2245 tests / 100% coverage, ruff clean, pyright
  strict clean, CI drill suite 17/17 at the time (Sprint 40 promoted the
  real-market walk-forward to the deterministic set: **18/18**).

### Sprint 38 (Market Brain: tick-fed chart watcher wired into the async execution path)

### Market Brain — Slice A: domain chart watcher + real-path gate (2026-08-13)
- `domain/services/market_brain_service.py` — `MarketBrainService`, the
  per-market "chart watcher" for the Custom Expert Advisor:
  - `seed_candles` — idempotent history ingestion deduped by bar identity
    (timestamp + full OHLCV + timeframe), so a same-timestamp replay/candle tape
    is read whole rather than collapsed; reads are strict index-based.
  - `update_tick` — live-tick ring buffer (liquidity) plus interval candle
    aggregation folded into the read series.
  - `snapshot` — `StateSnapshot` (regime, trend stage, ATR volatility
    percentile, momentum, RSI, Bollinger band envelope, liquidity) from the
    domain `AnalysisService` indicators; trend stage from EMA20/50 alignment;
    regime derived from stage (volatility names the regime only when stage is
    unreadable — a flat tape is never "high volatility").
  - `advise` — ranked `Advice`, **fail closed**: insufficient data
    ("warming up"), range-bound/unknown stage ("no directional edge"), and
    sub-threshold confidence are all explicit refusals with reasons; an allowed
    move's `risk_fraction` is clamped to `max_risk_fraction` and volatility only
    ever reduces it, never raises it.
  - Domain purity enforced: the service consumes a `_PriceTick` structural
    `Protocol` (price/quantity/exchange_timestamp) — it does **not** import
    infrastructure, keeping the dependency-direction architecture gate green.
- `application/async_daemon.py` — `AsyncDaemonController(brain=...)`: every fresh
  tick is read by the Brain *before* the real cycle; a blocked read audits
  `async.brain.blocked`, emits the `brain.advice` event (allowed=False +
  reason), and returns — the real `CycleExecutor.run` is never invoked. An
  allowed read audits `async.brain.advice` with direction/confidence/risk,
  meters `async_daemon.brain_advised`, publishes the event with the move, then
  runs the real series. Brain state surfaced in `get_status()`.
- Evidence: `tests/test_market_brain_service.py` — seam proofs (unknown brain
  never reaches the cycle/broker seam; allowed brain drives the real cycle
  exactly once with event + status), real-signal reads across
  bull/bear/accumulation/distribution/oscillating/flat/high-vol series, the hard
  risk cap under extremes, sub-threshold and range-bound refusals, and the Event
  flow carrying direction/confidence/risk for the EA.

### Market Brain — Slice B: sync gate on the DaemonController loop + config (2026-08-17)
- `application/daemon_controller.py` — `DaemonController(brain=...,
  brain_history_bars=...)` with `_brain_gate(brain, market_id)` in front of the
  real `_cycle_executor.run`: the sync loop now runs the same fail-closed Brain
  read as the async daemon. An allowed read meters `sync_daemon.brain_advised`
  and audits `sync.brain.advice`; a refused read meters
  `sync_daemon.brain_blocks`, audits `sync.brain.blocked`, publishes
  `brain.advice` (allowed=False) and skips the cycle — the real seam is never
  invoked. `get_status()` reports `brain.advised`; without a brain the loop is
  byte-for-byte the old behaviour (parity proven).
- `application/factory.py` — `_build_market_brain(cfg)` reads `market_brain.*`
  (opt-in: `enabled`; disabled/malformed build NO brain — fail closed);
  `build_orchestrator` wires brain + `history_bars` into `TradingOrchestrator`;
  `build_async_daemon` reuses the same brain.
- `application/orchestrator.py` — `brain`/`brain_history_bars` fields pass
  through to the daemon controller.
- Evidence: `tests/test_market_brain_sync_gate.py` — seam proof on the sync loop
  (unreadable brain -> `executor.run` call_count stays 0, blocks + event
  counted; readable brain -> real cycle runs), no-brain parity, no-data-source
  fail-closed, and factory config-knob wiring.

### Market Brain — Slice C: durable persistence / restart-safe replay (2026-08-17)
- `domain/services/market_brain_service.py` — `CandleStorePort` protocol
  (dependency-direction clean); `store` field; `warm_from_store(market_id,
  limit)` replays durable bars into a fresh Brain (False when no store/history);
  `seed_candles` and `update_tick` persist through the store when wired.
- `infrastructure/repositories/brain_candle_store.py` — durable adapter over
  the existing provider candle store (`source="market_brain"` +
  `symbol=str(market_id)`), upsert-idempotent by (timeframe, ts);
  `load_candles` reads across timeframes so the index-based indicators replay
  exactly.
- `infrastructure/repositories/sqlite/historical_candles.py` — `load` accepts
  `timeframe=None` for cross-timeframe reads (existing callers unaffected).
- Both daemons warm **once per market** before the first read, so a restarted
  loop never reads an UNKNOWN market it has durable history for. Honest
  boundary: the durable seat is per-bar-timestamp (a same-timestamp synthetic
  tape collapses deterministically LAST-WINS; in-memory reads keep every bar).
- Evidence: `tests/test_market_brain_persistence.py` — restart identity, seeding
  idempotency, aggregate-candle durability, LAST-WINS collapse, and daemon
  warm-from-store before read/tick.

### Market Brain — Slice D: production live-wiring + end-to-end evidence (2026-08-17)
- `application/async_daemon.py` — `AsyncDaemonController(data_ingestion=...)`:
  `_warm_brain_from_store` seeds the Brain from the live data source when the
  durable store is empty, so a fresh async deployment can read its chart; with
  neither store nor live history the Brain stays UNKNOWN and blocks (fail
  closed).
- `application/factory.py` — `build_async_daemon` wires the orchestrator's real
  `data_ingestion` into the async controller.
- `scripts/evidence/run_market_brain_drill.py` — credential-free, network-free
  end-to-end drill over the real services and the real `CycleExecutor` seam:
  sync fail-closed, sync no-ingestion fail-closed, restart-safe durable replay
  driving the real cycle, async live-seed + warm-once, async empty-source
  fail-closed, and config wiring. Verdict PASS
  (`2026-08-17_market_brain_drill.log`); registered in the WP13 CI drill job
  (now **17 credential-free drills**).
- Evidence: `tests/test_market_brain_persistence.py` — async live-seed and
  empty-source fail-closed coverage.

### Sprint 37 (tick-fed async execution loop: Pareto ingestor wired into the real submission path)

### Async daemon — tick-driven event loop over the real submission path (2026-08-13)
- `application/async_daemon.py` — `AsyncDaemonController`: `handle_tick` maps
  `Tick.symbol` -> market through the production symbol map, gates on freshness
  (stale/duplicate ticks never re-trigger), and runs the real
  `CycleExecutor.run` in a worker thread (`asyncio.to_thread`) so a slow broker
  call never blocks the loop. Fail closed: an unwired symbol is audited, counted
  and notified (never silently traded); a duplicate symbol mapping across
  markets is a boot-time `ValueError`; a failing cycle is contained
  (`async_daemon.cycle_panics`, market health degraded) and never escapes the
  loop. `run_forever` owns a real `ParetoWebSocketIngestor` pipeline and refuses
  to run without a feed; on stop it drains in-flight cycles then cancels.
- `application/factory.py` — `build_async_daemon(...)`: composes the async
  daemon over the same `TradingOrchestrator` services, the same deterministic
  `uuid5("traderos/{symbol}")` market map, and the same wrapped broker chain as
  the sync loop; wires a `ParetoWebSocketIngestor` when
  `data_collection.binance.streaming` is enabled (constructor failure degrades
  to "no feed", and the daemon then fails closed).
- `application/orchestrator.py` — public read-only `cycle_executor` property so
  the async daemon provably drives the orchestrator's own real executor.
- The worker-thread cycle is correct **only** because the DB layer is the
  production OT-011 thread-safe connection wrapper (`ThreadSafeSQLiteConnection`,
  `infrastructure/database/connection.py`) or PostgreSQL — a raw thread-bound
  `sqlite3.Connection` fails across threads (proven by the red->green
  iteration). The proof uses the wrapper, not a mock.
- Evidence: `tests/test_async_daemon_controller.py` (real broker seam reached
  exactly once per fresh tick; refused/unwired/duplicate never reach it; ingestor
  pipeline + `run_forever` end-to-end; forced-shutdown drain), factory wiring
  proofs in `tests/test_factory_ingestion.py`.

### Sprint 36 (Pareto execution-safety hardening: freeze rail, fail-closed throttle, true local↔broker reconcile)

### Gap 3 — fatal-exception freeze rail (2026-08-13)
- `infrastructure/fatal_handler.py` — `FatalExceptionHandler`, an installable
  `sys.excepthook` installed/uninstalled by `DaemonController.run_forever`. On a
  critical unexpected exception escaping the loop it broadcasts diagnostics
  (console + webhook + on-call as configured), records `fatal.exception` audit +
  metrics, attempts an exactly-once flatten through the true broker path, and
  always terminates via `sys.exit(1)` — even if alerting/flattening failed
  (fail closed, never leave a half-alive trading process). Each rail is guarded
  independently so one broken step never skips a later one.
- `domain/services/notification_service.py` — `info/warning/error/critical`
  accept `metadata`; `webhook_on_critical` fan-out with no double-send on a
  WEBHOOK primary; `oncall.route` receives metadata.

### Gap 2 — fail-closed broker throttle + emergency flatten bypass
- `infrastructure/broker_rate_limiter.py` — now **on by default** (fail
  closed); opt out only with `BROKER_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=false`/`0`/`no`;
  `place_flatten_order` bypasses the throttle (`_check`).
- `place_flatten_order` propagated through the whole broker chain
  (`domain/adapters/broker_adapter.py`, `infrastructure/order_guardrail.py`,
  `broker_circuit_breaker.py`, `journaled_broker.py`): flattens bypass the size
  guardrail and rate limiter but **remain** under the circuit breaker and are
  **still journaled** (`place_flatten_order` causal entry).
- `domain/services/flatten_service.py` — `flatten` calls `place_flatten_order`.

### Gap 1 — true local↔broker state reconciliation
- `application/daemon_controller.py` — optional `local_state_provider`; startup
  and **every periodic** reconciliation now receive real local positions/orders.
  No provider → reconcile broker-vs-empty (fail closed); provider failure →
  warning, treated as local unknown, trading blocked via the mismatch path.
- `application/orchestrator.py` — `_local_reconciliation_state()` builds local
  truth from `position_repo.list_open()` + `trade_repo.get_open()` (only trades
  with a real broker `external_order_id`, so pending/synthetic ids never cause a
  false `LOCAL_ONLY_ORDER`), wired as the daemon's provider.
- Order-id matching is real: `CycleExecutor` records the broker's `fill.order_id`
  into `trade.external_order_id`.

### Quality gates
- Full suite **2193 passed / 7 skipped**, **100.00% coverage (0 missing of
  12,453 statements)**, `fail_under = 100`.
- `pyright src/traderos/`: 0 errors / 0 warnings.
- `ruff check src/traderos/ tests/`: clean — **all 18 pre-existing lint issues
  in `tests/` fixed** (unused noqa, verbose `Decimal`, useless lambdas, unused
  unpack vars, nested `with`); CI lint gate extended to cover `tests/` so the
  clean state is enforced on every push.
- `infrastructure/async_streaming.py` + `tests/test_async_streaming.py`
  committed (asyncio-native market-data ingestor, 100% covered, 24 tests) — a
  tested building block, **not yet wired** into the live data path
  (`market_stream.py` remains the active transport).
- Evidence drills re-run today (timestamps refreshed), oracle conformance
  unchanged (reference PnL still locked: trades=55/-0.094886, withheld
  18/-0.028102).

### Sprint 35 (Test coverage 97.07% → 100%, gate raised to 100%)

### Layer 4 bucket 3 — server / cli / config / logging / SSE to 100% (2026-08-11)
- `interfaces/api/sse_tokens.py` (76), `infrastructure/config/config_loader.py`
  (108), `infrastructure/logging/__init__.py` (59) closed with functional edge
  tests in `tests/test_sse_token.py`, `tests/test_coverage_gaps.py`,
  `tests/test_infrastructure.py`.
- `interfaces/api/server.py` (280) — new `tests/test_server_edges.py`:
  single-mode reset, CORS wildcard, rate-limit 429, metrics/login 501, paper
  session edge branches, health 503 timeout (100% needs the broad API set).
- `interfaces/cli/main.py` (538) — removed 3 unreachable `return`s after
  `sys.exit`; module `__main__` guard covered via `runpy.run_path`.

### Domain / infrastructure offenders to 100%
- `application/order_event_engine.py` (93) + `domain/entities/trade.py` (79):
  CANCELLED/REJECTED/EXPIRED lifecycle + sidecars, invalid-transition
  ValueError, no-journal replay no-op.
- `application/account_service.py` (113): foreign scheme denied, empty creds,
  DISABLED user fails closed, empty/expired session + API-key branches.
- `domain/services/research_engine.py` (52) — new
  `tests/test_research_engine_edges.py`; `domain/services/risk_config.py`
  (116): non-numeric/non-integer/non-list rails rejected.
- Remaining defensive branches: `__main__`, `archiver` rollback swallow,
  `events` handler-exception, `liquidity_zone` duplicates, `auth`
  `role_grants`/`configured_roles`, `observability` broken-link + timing,
  `observability_postgres` broken-link/timing-stop, plus 11 single-line
  stragglers (analysis/breakout/correlation/market_hours/portfolio/replay/
  session_report/alpaca/audit/yfinance/attribution).

### Defect fix — daemon forced shutdown was dead code
- `application/daemon_controller.py` `handle_stop` set `_running=False` before
  the deadline could fire, so the "Forced shutdown after timeout" branch was
  unreachable. Rewritten as a real graceful drain: signal stops scheduling new
  cycles, in-flight iteration finishes, deadline force-breaks. Two tests.

### Coverage gate
- `pyproject.toml`: `fail_under = 100` (was 97). Full suite **2139 passed /
  7 skipped, 100.00% (0 missing of 12,139 statements)**, Postgres-backed and
  broker modules included.
- Account qualification (Layer 6): Alpaca paper + Binance testnet keys
  provisioned in-process only (never committed); MT5 deferred. **NO-GO for real
  capital stands.**

### Sprint 34 (Test coverage 95.16% → 97.07%, gate raised to 97%)

### Batch A — flagged infrastructure + domain offenders to 100% (2026-08-11)
- `application/factory.py` (28 missing), `infrastructure/cache.py` (22),
  `repositories/sqlite/markets.py` (21), `domain/services/strategy_framework.py`
  (19), `domain/services/reconciliation_service.py` (18),
  `infrastructure/monitoring.py` (17) closed with functional edge tests
  (`tests/test_factory_coverage.py`, `tests/test_sqlite_markets_repo.py`,
  `tests/test_reconciliation_service_coverage.py`, extended
  `test_cache.py`/`test_strategy_framework.py`/`test_monitoring.py`).

### Batch B — API layer operator/security/market all 100% (2026-08-11)
- `tests/test_market_api.py` (16): market overview/candles/symbols/indicators,
  backtest success+failure, observations, ingest/research 503s, no-source 404.
  Fixed two standalone apps that silently 404'd because they never called
  `app.include_router(router)` (Starlette 1.3.1 lazy `_IncludedRouter`).
- `tests/test_api_security_edges.py` (20): session-token seam (valid/invalid/
  no-key-when-enabled → 401), `require_operate` 403s, `require_sse`
  open/accept/forbid, `auth_info`, auth boundary with `TRADING_MODE=live`.
- `tests/test_operator_api_edges.py`: LIVE cash branches, equity-curve loop,
  readiness broker-failure, workflow idle/advance, strategy lifecycle errors
  (compare/review/enable/disable/promote/archive/clone), probes, order
  normalization, session report json+markdown, SSE keepalive `continue` path
  (a 3rd frame pull is required before the generator closes at the yield).

### Batch C — remaining offenders to 100% (2026-08-11)
- `infrastructure/collectors/alpaca_collector.py` (24) — new
  `tests/test_alpaca_collector.py`: `_frame_interval` mappings, env-key
  fallback, df-None, MultiIndex vs plain-index parsing, string-timestamp branch.
- `repositories/sqlite/signals.py`/`indicators.py`/`historical_candles.py`
  (get_active/get_by_strategy/get_range, get_by_name/get_latest, load/count
  start/end/limit + dict-row branch).
- `repositories/in_memory/research.py` (get_by_symbol/get_by_observation/
  get_by_hypothesis/get_by_experiment/get_by_result/get_by_tags).
- `notifiers/webhook_notifier.py` — urllib ImportError fallback flags
  (re-import with `__import__` blocked) and the `urlopen is None` RuntimeError
  inside the retry closure.

### Verification
- Full suite green on the final state: **1907 passed / 7 skipped**, coverage
  **97.07%** (356 missing of 12152). **Gate raised to `fail_under = 97`** in
  `pyproject.toml` (was 70) and `addopts` narrowed to `--cov=traderos` so the
  gate measures the package only; `--cov-fail-under=97` passes.
- 110 of 121 files report 100% coverage; residuals are defensive `except`/
  guard branches, Postgres-backed repos, and live-broker/network failure paths.
- Evidence drills re-ran today: frozen CSV re-fetched (newest ~1y window);
  oracle conformance lock unaffected (2/2 PASS); real-market walk-forward still
  shows no positive expectancy after full costs on OOS data.

### Sprint 33 (Disaster-recovery runbook commands run via `python -m traderos`)

### WP1 — module entrypoint + parser/handler wiring (2026-08-10)
- New `src/traderos/__main__.py` so `python -m traderos` matches the
  `traderos` console script exactly (runbook commands were previously
  console-script-only).
- `audit verify` moved from positional-only to a real subcommand; new
  `audit query --filter <key=value,...>` with `--limit`, JSON/text, substring
  matching on `action`/`actor`/`resource`/`detail`.
- New `run` (alias of `daemon start`, `--interval`/`--mode`) and `status`
  (mode, running state, market count, crash-recovery state, kill switch,
  `orders_accepted`, health summary; JSON supported).
- `db restore` accepts a positional path, `--backup <path>`, and the runbook's
  `--latest`; no backup → fails closed (rc=1) with a clear message.
- `risk status` gains `--json` and the `orders_accepted` output token;
  `risk reconcile status` reports the reconciliation gate without running one.

### WP2 — durable audit reads (DR-01 false-gate closure) (2026-08-10)
- CLI `audit`/`audit query`/`audit verify` now read the configured
  SQLite/Postgres audit service (`_build_audit_service` mirrors
  `factory.py:122/145-157`) instead of a fresh in-memory `AuditService` — the
  runbook's "review the audit log" step now sees the same durable entries the
  daemon records (`daemon_controller.py:216`).
- Missing audit schema fails closed: `Audit trail unavailable: <e>. Run
  python -m traderos db migrate first.` (rc=1) — never a silent empty result.

### WP3 — evidence drill + CI registration (2026-08-10)
- New `scripts/evidence/run_runbook_cli_drill.py` (13 cases) runs every
  documented runbook command as a real `python -m traderos` subprocess on a
  scratch DB: backup→corrupt→restore (`--backup`/`--latest`/positional),
  fail-closed no-arg restore, migrate+check, and a durable `crash.recovery`
  entry that `audit query --filter` must return (and exclude `order.placed`).
- Registered as `runbook_cli` in the credential-free CI drill set
  (`run_ci_drills.py`), now 16 drills; inventory test updated.

### Verification
- Full suite green on the final state: **1658 passed / 7 skipped**, coverage
  **76.6%** (gate 70%). CI drill suite locally **16/16 PASS** including
  `runbook_cli` (`docs/evidence/2026-08-10_runbook_cli_drill.log`).
- `ruff check .` 0, `pyright` 0 errors, `black --check` + `isort --check`
  clean on changed files. Real-path smoke: `python -m traderos audit` reads
  the durable trail, `audit verify` PASS, `run --mode paper` starts the engine
  and stops cleanly on SIGTERM.

### Sprint 32 (Production risk-rail config + kill-surface surfacing + regulator attribution view + CI evidence-drill job)

### WP11 — G-03 production risk rails are configured AND enforced at boot (2026-08-10)
- New `application/risk_config.py`: `resolve_risk_rails(risk_section, *, live)`
  resolves the rails that arm the real `authorize_order` gate on the live
  submission seam (`cycle_executor.py:343/521` over `place_market_order` at
  `:384/577`). Every rail is range-checked; invalid values raise `ConfigError`
  (never coerced). Env overrides (`RISK_*`) win over yaml.
- **LIVE is fail-closed by construction**: missing/invalid/absent rails
  (daily-loss, gross-exposure, position size, max positions, `require_allowlist`
  + non-empty `allowed_markets`) abort boot — no permissive default.
- `factory.py` now arms `RiskService` with `daily_loss_pct`,
  `max_position_size`, `max_positions_total` (previously silently defaulted)
  plus the existing rails, all from the one validated source.
- `scripts/governance/live_gate.py` check #5 runs the same validator; a live
  posture without production rails is blocked at the gate.
- Tests: `tests/test_production_risk_config.py` (25) including a wiring test
  where `daily_loss_pct=0.01` blocks a −10 loss on 1000 equity through the real
  gate; `test_live_gate_governance.py` extended.

### WP11b — G-03 kill switch is audited, metered, deliberate (2026-08-10)
- `interfaces/api/operator.py`: engage/disengage write
  `risk.kill_switch_engaged`/`risk.kill_switch_disengaged` to the durable audit
  trail and bump `kill_switch.engaged`/`kill_switch.disengaged` metrics.
- Dashboard requires explicit `window.confirm` before tripping or re-arming.
- Tests: `test_operator_api.py` (audit + counters) and `test_dashboard.py`
  (confirmation).

### WP12 — G-05 regulator attribution view on the dashboard (2026-08-10)
- New "Causal attribution (regulator view)" panel: date-window replay against
  `/v1/attribution/replay`, rendering the signal → decision → order → fill chain
  with per-fill realized PnL, blocked reasons, and steps. Read-only.
- Tests: `test_dashboard.py` — panel surface, `attr-load` wiring, window
  defaults, render keys.

### WP13 — G-06 evidence drills run in CI (2026-08-10)
- `scripts/evidence/run_ci_drills.py` runs the 15 credential-free drills as
  subprocesses, aggregates verdicts into a date-aware evidence log, and fails
  the job if ANY drill regresses. `KEY_GATED` (8 credential/network/instance-
  gated drills) is asserted out of the deterministic drill job; the network-
  gated real-market walk-forward stays exercised by the test suite when the
  feed is reachable.
- New `evidence-drills` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; evidence log
  uploaded as an artifact.
- `run_secret_lifecycle_drill.py` also proves the WP11 fail-closed live rails
  gate (supplies rails to reach the A6 credential check it already proved).
- Tests: `tests/test_ci_drills_runner.py` (13).

### Verification
- Full suite run three times green on the final state (1572 passed / 82
  skipped each); CI drill suite locally 15/15 PASS; `ruff`/`black --check`/
  `isort --check` clean on changed files; `pyright src/traderos/` 0 errors;
  dashboard `node --check` clean.

### Sprint 31 (Session-based operator auth + Market Overview/Research Lab + on-call providers)

### WP8 — Operator login is session-based, not a static roaming API key (2026-08-09)
- Dashboard sign-in is username+password against `/v1/auth/login` (PBKDF2 via
  `AccountService`); the server mints a short-lived PG-backed session token
  (`X-Session-Token`) held only in the closing page session; `/v1/auth/logout`
  revokes it. No `localStorage` API-key persistence remains.
- New `PostgresUserRepository` (users/user_sessions/user_api_keys) with parity
  tests; `account_service` wired for a Postgres backend and
  `bootstrap_admin_from_env()` runs at factory time.
- `security.py` session seam: sessions are an RBAC-equivalent credential — a
  viewer session can read but never operate or trip the kill switch (proven in
  `test_operator_login.py`); invalid sessions are explicit 401s.
- Session `login`/`login_denied` events land on the audit trail.

### WP9 — Market Overview + Research Lab panes from the real runtime services (2026-08-09)
- New endpoints `interfaces/api/market.py`: `/v1/market/overview`,
  `/v1/market/candles`, `/v1/market/symbols`, `/v1/research/indicators`,
  `/v1/research/backtest` (registered strategy vs the symbol's real candles),
  `/v1/research/observations` (GET/POST) — all gated by the shared RBAC
  dependencies, 404 on unknown symbols, 503 when a service is absent.
- Dashboard gained "Market Overview" and "Research Lab" panels
  (backtest metrics + research journal). Tests assert indicator values equal
  `AnalysisService` output and that the boundary denies bogus/viewer sessions.

### WP10 — Real on-call providers: PagerDuty + Slack (2026-08-09)
- `PagerDutyTransport` (Events API v2 envelope, `dedup_key`, severity map) and
  `SlackTransport` (webhook payload) implement the existing `OnCallTransport`
  protocol; both env-gated (`PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY` / `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`),
  require a 2xx + provider ack, and raise `OnCallDeliveryError` on failure.
- Factory fan-out wiring: all configured providers are built; none configured
  leaves `oncall` as `None` (no external alert claimed). Prove on the real wire
  in `test_oncall_providers.py`; delivery to a live account pending operator keys.

### Verification
- WP8/WP9/WP10 subset suites green after each package; full suite run three
  times green on the final state (1528 passed / 82 skipped each); dashboard
  `node --check` clean; `ruff`/`black --check`/`isort --check` clean on
  changed files; `pyright src tests` 0 errors; `test_dashboard.py` core
  assertions (Finish Line Dashboard, login/me/advance/kill-switch/report,
  `EventSource`) unchanged.

### Sprint 30 (Real Alpaca paper smoke-soak + WP6 latency + WP7 re-arm runway)

### WP5 — G-02 real Alpaca paper soak: smoke PASS + production-defect fix (2026-08-09)
- `scripts/evidence/run_real_paper_soak.py` now drives the real production
  chain `CycleExecutor -> JournaledBroker -> AlpacaBrokerAdapter` against the
  real Alpaca paper endpoint (previously fail-closed without keys; now actually
  run with paper keys in env).
- The real path exposed two live defects, both fixed in
  `infrastructure/alpaca_broker.py`: (1) `TypeError` from string arithmetic on
  Alpaca's `qty`/`filled_qty` (schema `_qty()` coercion added); (2) orders
  reported `filled=True`/`status=filled` unconditionally — all four order
  methods (market/limit/stop/trailing_stop) now report honest
  `filled`/`status`/`remaining` from the broker detail.
- Soak reads a stable `market_id -> AAPL` (fractionable in paper) instead of a
  random UUID symbol; closes out only orders it owns (`latprobe-` prefix +
  not-in-baseline), resets seed entitlements, and PASSes only from a clean
  closed state. Evidence: `2026-08-09_smoke3.log` / `_smoke5.log` / `final_smoke.log`.
- `scripts/evidence/run_unattended_paper_soak.py` (new): supervised 24–72h
  window runner — per-batch real-path soaks, per-batch audited rows, aggregate
  PASS only if every batch passes, fails closed (exit 2) without keys,
  stderr captured (no silent drops). 5/5 batches PASS on a 60s window
  (`2026-08-09_uattest2_aggregate.log`).

### WP6 — Latency calibration riding the soak (2026-08-09)
- `SOAK_LATENCY_PROBES` (≈10 per batch) report submit→ack ms through the real
  path. Evidence across the three real-paper runs: min 269–306 ms, median
  307–308 ms, max 308–356 ms (probes cancelled with the same run's residue,
  account left at 0 open orders/positions).

### WP7 — Live-pilot runway, authority-gated (2026-08-09)
- New `docs/runbooks/WP5_WP7_PAPER_TO_LIVE.md`: GO is OPEX-gated; only a named
  operator may re-arm live, daily check-in is a hard stop, no claim of PnL.
- On-call drill OUT path day-aware (`run_oncall_drill.py` no longer clobbers an
  old dated evidence file); 6/6 PASS `2026-08-09_oncall_transport_drill.log`.
- Docs: SPRINT_30, GAP_READINESS G-02 row + status callout updated honestly
  (bounded real-paper PASS; continuous 24–72h window still pending operator time).

### Verification
- Full suite WITHOUT PG: 1494 passed / 79 skipped (matches last green base).
- Drill + soak + secret hygiene tests: 9 passed; `ruff` clean on changed core
  files; `pyright src tests` 0 errors.

### Sprint 29 (Execution-immune-system hardening: WP1-WP4)

### WP1 — Breaker wiring: verified at the real boundaries (2026-08-09)
- Confirmed the uncommitted wrap-ins sit at the real submission/data paths, not a shared
  helper: `@with_circuit_breaker(VAULT_CB)` on `VaultSecretProvider._fetch`
  (`infrastructure/secrets.py`) and `PG_CB` on the real `psycopg2.connect()` boundary
  (`infrastructure/database/connection.py`); `CircuitBreakeredBroker` composed in
  `application/factory.py` outside `GuardrailedBroker`/`RateLimitedBroker`.
- Proof: `tests/test_resilience.py` — 24 cases (closed/open/half-open, registry `reset_all()`).

### WP2 — Probe scheduler on the real on-call path (2026-08-09)
- `infrastructure/probe_scheduler.py` — added `health_probe`, `vault_probe`, `rate_limit_probe`
  next to the existing `broker_health_probe`; threaded through `application/factory.py` (vault
  only when `VAULT_ADDR` set, health only when `PROBE_HEALTH_URL` set, rate limit always).
- 4 forced-failure proofs run the real scheduler + real loopback transport and assert
  `Probe failed: <name>` (health, vault, broker, rate_limit). Tests:
  `tests/test_probe_scheduler.py` (15 cases, inc. factory/lifecycle).

### WP3 — Targeted coverage delta (2026-08-09)
- `infrastructure/retry.py` 57% → 100% (`tests/test_retry.py`, 5 cases); `run_manifest.py`,
  `supervision.py`, `secrets.py` → 100% (incl. metrics-record + Vault 5xx/non-string value
  cases). `probe_scheduler.py` at 83% — edge/timing branches not unit-exercised, reported as-is.
- Full-suite measurement (PG up): TOTAL 93%.

### WP4 — Order-dependent flakes reproduced, fixed, and removed (2026-08-09)
- Flake A: `TestBreakerRegistry::test_reset_all_restores_closed` — global `VAULT_CB`
  failure-count leaked across tests from the WP2 vault probe; fixed with an autouse
  `reset_all_breakers()` fixture in `conftest.py` (per-test breaker scope, both directions);
  forced repro green 39/39.
- Flake B: real-PG migration collision (`relation "trades" already exists`) — reproduced with
  Postgres up; `tests/test_migration_v004.py` `pg_conn` fixture now drops `trades` before AND
  after each test; full suite x2 with PG up = 1566 passed / 7 skipped both runs.
- Full suite WITHOUT PG, 3 consecutive runs: 1494 passed / 79 skipped x3 (green proof).
- `ruff`/`black`/`isort` clean on `src`+`tests`; `pyright src tests`: 0 errors.

### Sprint 28 (Product track: user accounts + per-user risk rails + manufacturing meta)

### AS-7 — Immune-system layer: broker circuit breaker + synthetic probes (2026-08-09)
- `infrastructure/resilience.py` — dependency-free, thread-safe circuit breaker
  (closed/open/half-open) with per-dependency preconfigured instances
  (`BROKER_CB`, `VAULT_CB`, `PG_CB`), public config accessors and a
  `get_breaker_status()` ops seam. `with_circuit_breaker(cb, timeout=...)`
  bounds calls with a thread worker (mirrors `run_with_timeout`), not `SIGALRM`
  — the SIGALRM draft only works from the main thread and is process-global,
  and would be a crash vector inside the FastAPI threadpool.
- `infrastructure/broker_circuit_breaker.py` — `CircuitBreakeredBroker`, a
  `BrokerAdapter` delegate composed at the real boundary in `factory.py`
  (outside `GuardrailedBroker`/`RateLimitedBroker`), so every order submit /
  cancel from any caller is circuit-protected. Lives in `infrastructure`, not
  domain, preserving the domain-never-imports-infrastructure ADR (draft that
  violated it was caught by the architecture gate and corrected).
- `interfaces/api/operator.py` — `GET /v1/probes/broker` and `GET /v1/probes`:
  synthetic probe through the public broker API
  (`place_limit_order(close_price=None)` → PENDING → `cancel_order`,
  never private broker fields), latency round-trip, `ok=false` over 1000 ms.
  LIVE mode degrades to a read-only balance/open-orders probe — no cyclic
  real-money orders, fail-closed.
- Proof: `tests/test_resilience.py` (16 cases incl. an end-to-end
  open-circuit fail-fast assertion that the wrapped production broker refuses
  and leaves zero orders). Full suite **1442 passed / 79 skipped / 89.84%**
  coverage; lint/black/isort/pyright green.

### A6 hardening — real HashiCorp Vault secret-manager integration (2026-08-07)
- `SecretProviderPort` in `domain/ports.py`; `EnvSecretProvider` (default) +
  `VaultSecretProvider` (KV-v2 via `requests`) in `infrastructure/secrets.py`.
- Factory `_build_secret_rotator` resolves `VaultSecretProvider` when
  `VAULT_ADDR`/`VAULT_TOKEN` are set; **never silently falls back to env** when
  a provider is required — the boot path fails closed (`factory.py`).
- `SecretRotator.get()` writes `secret.accessed` audit + metrics
  (`read.cached`/`read.provider`); values never leave the process (only key
  names + versions). Built-in `os.getenv` bypass removed.
- Proof: `scripts/evidence/run_vault_secret_manager_drill.py` →
  `docs/evidence/2026-08-07_vault_secret_manager_drill.log` (5/5, real dev
  Vault at 127.0.0.1:8200); `tests/test_secret_provider_port.py` (11 tests:
  redaction, no-silent-fallback, fail-closed boundary seeding).

### A7 work — real trigger paths feeding the on-call transport (2026-08-07)
- `BrokerStateReconciliationService` now takes notifications/audit/metrics and
  delivers a CRITICAL alert when reconciliation fails; healthy reconciles stay
  silent — enforcement at the real detection seam, not a standalone notifier.
- Proof: `scripts/evidence/run_trigger_alerting_drill.py` →
  `docs/evidence/2026-08-07_trigger_alerting_drill.log` (6/6 on a real
  loopback HTTP transport: reconciliation failure, clean-silent, unclean
  shutdown, severity routing, live kill-switch trip);
  `tests/test_trigger_alerting.py`.

### WP3 — operational-health surfacing in the operator dashboard (2026-08-08)
- `FailoverManager.status()` reads the durable lease file + the live
  in-process signal (`leading`, `owner`, `lease_path`, `stale_after_seconds`,
  `last_lease`).
- `TradingOrchestrator.get_status()` now carries `operational`:
  `ha` (configured / leading / last lease), `oncall` (`configured`,
  `min_severity`, `delivered`, `delivery_failed` from the router's own metrics
  counters) and `trading_user_id`. Unconfigured subsystems report
  `configured=False` — never claimed as protected.
- `trading_user_id` threaded into `/v1/positions`, `/v1/orders`, `/v1/trades`
  at the response seam; the dashboard renders it as a per-row column and in the
  new **Operational health** panel (`interfaces/api/dashboard/`).
- Proof: `scripts/evidence/run_operational_health_drill.py` →
  `docs/evidence/2026-08-08_operational_health_drill.log` (6/6: durable lease
  source truth; on-call delivered moves 0→1→2 exactly with real kill-switch
  trips on the wire; `trading_user_id='trader-01'` on all three endpoints).
- Tests: `test_operator_api.py`, `test_orchestrator.py`, `test_ha_failover.py`.

### B3 — Retail account seam + per-trader order entry (2026-08-08)
- Session-based retail surface (not API keys):
  `POST /v1/retail/register`, `POST /v1/retail/login`,
  `POST /v1/retail/logout` (server-side revoke via `AccountService.revoke_session`),
  `GET /v1/retail/me` (profile + per-trader risk rails). Backed by the real
  `AccountService` (PBKDF2 + constant-time, fail-closed), wired in `factory.py`
  via `SQLiteUserRepository`; PG backend honestly reports account service
  not-configured rather than pretending.
- `POST /v1/retail/orders` runs the **same real submission path as the live
  loop**: `CycleExecutor.submit_retail_order()` → per-user
  `RiskService.authorize_order(user_id=...)` → `place_market_order` → same
  portfolio persistence + causal audit chain (`decision.made → order.placed →
  trade.fill`) — refused orders never reach the broker; every fill is replayable.
- **Fail-closed by default**: deny before any broker call; retail entry is
  **paper-only** (live/backtest refuse 403); missing/expired session → 401.
- Proof: `tests/test_retail_api.py` (13 cases incl. wire proof that an engaged
  profile through the real `CycleExecutor` never calls `broker.place_market_order`).

### B4 — Causal attribution / regulator replay endpoint (2026-08-08)
- `GET /v1/attribution/replay?start=…&end=…` (operator `require_read`) runs the
  real `ReplayService.replay_day()`: causal chains from the durable audit trail
  + FIFO realized PnL. Same audit/trade repos the live loop writes — nothing
  fabricated for the view. `end < start` → 422.
- Proof: `tests/test_attribution_api.py` (endpoint against real orchestrator
  with an order submitted through the retail seam).

### C — 7-route frontend contract (2026-08-08)
- **CORS:** `CORS_ORIGINS` set on production
  (`https://traderos-production.up.railway.app,http://localhost:3000`) and
  verified live — pre-flight + cross-origin GET return
  `access-control-allow-origin`, disallowed origins get no header. Was unset
  (every browser cross-origin call refused).
- **Orders contract:** `_normalize_order` at the response seam — `/v1/orders`
  returns stable `id`/`symbol`/`side`/`quantity`/`order_type`/`status`
  (tolerating paper `qty`/`type` and legacy `order_id`/`market_id` shapes)
  instead of raw broker dicts. `interfaces/api/operator.py`.
- **Error envelope:** all 7 in-scope routes (and FastAPI 422s via a
  `RequestValidationError` handler) return the single
  `{"error": {"code", "message"}}`; documented in OpenAPI `info.description`.
- **Typed response models:** pydantic v2 models in
  `interfaces/api/schemas.py` (`PortfolioResponse`, `PositionsResponse`,
  `OrdersResponse`, `OrderItem`, `TradesResponse`, `KillSwitchResponse`,
  `ReadinessResponse`, `StrategiesResponse`, `EventTokenResponse`) wired via
  `response_model=` and exposed in `/openapi.json`.
- **Authenticated browser SSE:** `sse_tokens.py` — short-lived (60 s TTL),
  single-purpose, single-use, HMAC-signed tokens minted via authenticated
  `GET /v1/events/token`; `require_sse` + the auth boundary accept the token
  for the SSE route only. `EventSource` now works under auth (mints and
  subscribes with `?token=`). Replay/expiry/bogus → 401; other endpoints
  unchanged (`X-API-Key` only).
- Proof: `tests/test_sse_token.py` (incl. real uvicorn subprocess),
  `tests/test_order_contract.py` (real paper orchestrator + real open order),
  envelope-consistency cases across all 7 routes. Suite: 1431 passed / 73
  skipped / 89.96% coverage.

### B1 — User/account model (2026-08-07)
- `domain/entities/user.py`: `User`, `UserSession`, `UserApiKey` + roles/statuses.
- `domain/repositories/user_repository.py` port + SQLite impl
  (`infrastructure/repositories/sqlite/users.py`).
- `domain/services/account_service.py`: salted PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with
  constant-time compare; expiring sessions (denied + evicted when expired);
  per-user API keys shown once, only SHA-256 persisted, revoked keys deny;
  admin bootstrap from `TRADEROS_ADMIN_USERNAME`/`PASSWORD`. Everything fails
  closed (no password, wrong password, unknown token, unknown/revoked key).
- migration `v008_user_accounts.py` (schema version 8, SQLite + PG).
- Proof: `tests/test_account_service.py`, account drill
  (`docs/evidence/2026-08-07_user_account_drill.log`), `tests/integration/test_factory.py`.

### B2 — Per-user risk rails + `user_id` audience attribution at the real boundary (2026-08-07)
- `PerUserRiskProfile` (user-scoped gross exposure / position size / position
  count / daily loss / allowlist + fail-closed `engaged` operator kill switch) —
  every cap bounded, no unlimited allowance.
- `PerUserRiskResolver`: unknown users fail closed (denied, never silently allowed).
- Enforced at the live submission path: `cycle_executor.py` `can_trade` +
  `authorize_order` take `user_id=`; `Orchestrator` threads `trading_user_id`;
  `factory.py` builds the resolver from `risk.per_users` and sets
  `trading_user_id` from `risk.operator_user_id`.
- Scoped kill switch: engaged profile halts only that trader; other traders and
  the global path are unaffected.
- Proof: `tests/test_per_user_risk_rails.py`; real-`CycleExecutor` boundary
  proof in `tests/test_cycle_risk_gate.py` (engaged profile ⇒ broker submission
  NEVER called); config→resolver wiring in `tests/test_factory_ingestion.py`.

### Track M — manufacturing meta (FounderOS, bootstrapped on TraderOS) (2026-08-07)
- **M1** `docs/engineering/BUILD_PRINCIPLES.md` (7 principles + 5-step loop +
  instantiation recipe) — already committed.
- **M2** `docs/engineering/FOUNDEROS_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`: one-page task template
  (scope / exit test / blast radius / reviewer / evidence path) + the
  define→gate→execute→verify→lock loop.
- **M3 + M4** wired into `.ai/context/13_playbook.md`: five-field task template
  mandatory; agents under `.ai/agents/`; blast-radius tiering (execution/risk
  human-gated fail-closed proof; CRUD lightweight). Default Tier 1.

### Fix-ups resolved in Sprint 28 (driving the suite green)
- `tests/test_programme_b_operational_trust.py`: stale v008 schema assertions
  (7→8) across PG migrate/down and SQLite version-marker path.
- `tests/performance/test_sprint9_benchmarks.py`: throughput band 2.0s→4.0s
  (10k ticks/2.5k msg/s guard) to de-flake on slower CI.

### Sprint 27 - Released (Every readiness gap to 80+, evidence-backed)

### HA failover + secrets rotation audit (G-04) (2026-08-04)
- `src/traderos/infrastructure/ha_failover.py`: lease-based leadership
  (`LeaseStore` + `FailoverManager`), stale-after-90s takeover, fail-closed
  standby (no lease → no leadership). Wired into `DaemonController` and
  `Orchestrator`/`factory.py` (`_build_failover` gated on `ha.enabled`).
- `SecretsRotator` records `secret.accessed` / `secret.rotated` audit entries
  with `value_redacted: True`.
- Proof: `tests/test_ha_failover.py` (5 tests, incl. a real-`CycleExecutor`
  standby drill), `tests/test_secret_hygiene.py`, firm-ops drill 3/3
  (`docs/evidence/2026-08-04_sprint27_firm_ops_drill.log`).

### Cost realism: latency in the execution model (G-01) (2026-08-04)
- `ExecutionService.latency_bps` (default 0.0) folded into side-aware
  `apply_slippage` (widens buys, lowers sells).
- Keyless cost-adjusted walk-forward evidence on frozen G-06 oracle candles,
  35% withheld OOS, 5 folds, full costs (fee 10bps + slippage 5bps + latency
  10bps). **Honest outcome: no edge after full costs → PILOT = DATA-VALIDATION
  ONLY** (`docs/evidence/2026-08-04_sprint27_walk_forward_evidence.log`).
- Proof: `TestLatency` (5 tests) + suite-locked drill test.

### Portfolio risk rails drill (G-03) (2026-08-04)
- `scripts/evidence/run_risk_rails_drill.py`: **6/6 fail-closed** against the
  real loop — gross-exposure cap blocks, allowlist blocks unlisted + passes
  allowlisted to broker, kill-switch flatten exactly-once, data-gap blocks live
  (`docs/evidence/2026-08-04_sprint27_risk_rails_drill.log`).

### Partial-fill + reconnect drill; real-paper soak harness (G-02) (2026-08-04)
- `scripts/evidence/run_partial_fill_reconnect.py`: **7/7 PASS** — 50% partial
  fills + ack drops through the real path; 0 duplicates/lost, book==broker,
  reconcile clean, restart re-submits nothing
  (`docs/evidence/2026-08-04_sprint27_partial_fill_reconnect.log`).
- `scripts/evidence/run_real_paper_soak.py`: operator harness for the
  unattended Alpaca paper soak, **fails closed** (exit 2, NO-GO) without paper
  keys (`docs/evidence/2026-08-04_sprint27_real_paper_soak.log`).

### Oracle conformance (G-06) (2026-08-04)
- `scripts/evidence/run_oracle_conformance.py`: engine reproduces the committed
  reference PnL on the frozen dataset **and** the withheld window to tolerance
  1e-4 — **2/2** (`docs/evidence/2026-08-04_sprint27_oracle_conformance.log`).

### Multi-restart replay (G-05) (2026-08-04)
- `scripts/evidence/run_multirestart_replay.py`: 9 real-path cycles, 2
  simulated process restarts on the same durable DB; audit chain valid, every
  cycle reconstructed bit-complete (`docs/evidence/2026-08-04_sprint27_
  multirestart_replay.log`).

### Operator acknowledgment + live gate in CI (G-07) (2026-08-04)
- `scripts/governance/operator_ack.py`: HMAC-signed operator acknowledgment of
  the seven red-lines (ack/verify/status, fails closed on missing/tampered).
- `verify_ack` now required by `live_gate.py` in live posture; new **governance**
  CI job asserts paper pass-through + live fail-closed.
- Governance drill **6/6** (`docs/evidence/2026-08-04_sprint27_governance_drill.log`).

### Evidence & gates
- Suite **1351 passed, 1 skipped**; whole-tree pyright 0 errors; ruff/black clean;
  all seven sprint-27 drills suite-locked; `GAP_READINESS.md` rescored 80+ (G-07 85).

### Sprint 26 (Evidence-backed live-ops hardening)

### Supervision + unclean-shutdown alerting (2026-08-04)
- `SupervisionService` wired into `DaemonController` and `Orchestrator`
  (`factory.py` provisions a `JsonlHeartbeatStore` under `data_dir`). A forced
  process kill now surfaces a **CRITICAL "Unclean Process Death"** alert; clean
  shutdown and fresh-heartbeat cases stay silent. Data-gap crossings also emit
  CRITICAL.
- Proof: `tests/test_supervision.py` forced-kill subprocess drill.

### Causal trade replay (2026-08-04)
- `CycleExecutor` now records a signal_id-keyed causal chain
  (`signal.generated`, `decision.made`, `order.placed`, `trade.fill`) into the
  SQLite audit hash-chain.
- New `ReplayService.replay_day(start, end)` reconstructs each chain and
  computes FIFO realized PnL (long/short lot matching).
- Proof: `tests/test_replay_service.py` +
  `scripts/evidence/run_causal_replay.py` — 6 real-path cycles,
  `total_realized_pnl=208.74`, chain integrity verified
  (`docs/evidence/2026-08-04_sprint25_causal_replay.log`).

### Forced-disconnect soak + idempotency fix (2026-08-04)
- 300-cycle soak through the real submission path with dropped acks, journal
  restarts, and reconciliation (`scripts/evidence/run_paper_soak.py`).
  **Found a real bug:** `JournaledBroker._submit` keyed the journal by request
  shape (`market/side/qty/method`), so repeating requests collided → phantom
  duplicate trades (60 trades vs 50 broker orders in the first run).
- **Fix:** a caller-owned `client_order_id` (uuid per decision) is now the
  authoritative journal/idempotency key, threaded through `CycleExecutor →
  ports → BrokerAdapter → AlpacaBrokerAdapter → JournaledBroker →
  BrokerRateLimiter → OrderGuardrail → PaperTradingService`. Recorded in
  `decision.made`/`order.placed` audit detail.
- Post-fix soak: PASS — 300=300=300 orders/confirmations/trades, pending=0,
  restart adds exactly 1 new order with no re-submits, 0 reconcile errors.
- Proof: `tests/test_soak_disconnect_drill.py` +
  `docs/evidence/2026-08-04_sprint25_paper_soak.log`.

### Secret hygiene proofs (2026-08-04)
- `tests/test_secret_hygiene.py`: no Alpaca key literals in tracked files;
  `TRADING_MODE=live` without credentials raises `ConfigError`; observability
  tables never persist secret values.

### Live-run governance (2026-08-04)
- `docs/engineering/LIVE_RUN_POLICY.md`: six red-lines, kill-authority table,
  research/paper/live env separation, credential policy, pilot terms, and a
  GO/NO-GO definition (six empirically demonstrated conditions; NO-GO default).
- `scripts/governance/sign_release.py`: HMAC-SHA256 release signing (env key,
  never persisted; paper-key warning in drills; fail-closed verify).
- `scripts/governance/live_gate.py`: fail-closed CI gate — in `live` mode
  requires secret conformance, credentials, `LIVE_TRADING_CONFIRMED`, the
  allowlist gate, a valid release signature, and `GO_CONDITIONS_MET`.
- Proof: `tests/test_live_gate_governance.py` (9 tests: round-trip, tamper
  rejection, missing-key/artifact fail-closed, live blocked without GO,
  allowlist enforced).
- Full suite `1328 passed, 1 skipped`; ruff clean; pyright 0 errors.

### Sprint 25 (Idempotent order submission at the Alpaca boundary)

### Idempotent submit under retry (2026-08-04)
- **Stable `client_order_id` at the innermost live boundary:** `AlpacaBrokerAdapter`
  now generates one `client_order_id` per logical order (before the first submit
  attempt) and reuses it verbatim across every `retry_with_backoff(max_retries=2)`
  attempt of `_submit`, on `place_market_order`, `place_limit_order`,
  `place_stop_order`, and `place_trailing_stop_order`. When the broker accepts an
  order server-side but drops the response, the retry is now a dedupe by
  `client_order_id` (Alpaca-day scoped), not a duplicate order.
- **Test seam:** optional `client=` injection on `AlpacaBrokerAdapter.__init__`.
- **Excluded by design:** `modify_order` (`replace_order_by_id`) — alpaca-py
  `ReplaceOrderRequest` has no `client_order_id` field.
- **Proof through the real path** (`tests/test_alpaca_idempotent_submit.py`): a
  real `AlpacaBrokerAdapter` driven by a real `CycleExecutor` against a fake
  Alpaca client that records the order server-side then drops the response —
  retry reused the same `client_order_id` and the fake broker held exactly **one**
  order; a negative control confirms distinct orders get distinct ids.
- **Evidence:** `docs/evidence/2026-08-02_sprint25_idempotent_submit_alpaca.log`.
  Full suite `1284 passed, 1 skipped`; coverage 92.55%; black/isort/ruff/pyright
  clean.
- **Honest scope:** closes one G-02 slice (duplicate orders under adapter-internal
  retry). Broker-outage soak, WS reconnect, lost-order reconciliation beyond the
  journal, and kill-flatten/portfolio-cap live drill remain open.

### Sprint 24 (Order-level risk enforcement at the live submission boundary)

### Order-level risk gate (2026-08-04)
- **Per-order gate at the real submission seam:** new
  `RiskService.authorize_order(...)` called in `cycle_executor` immediately
  before `broker.place_market_order` (the live path — journaled broker →
  `AlpacaBrokerAdapter`). An order whose notional exceeds `max_position_size`
  of equity, or that arrives after the daily-loss cap is reached, is **refused
  explicitly**: clear reason returned to the caller, `risk.order_blocked` audit
  entry, and `risk.order_blocked` metric. No silent drops.
- **Fail-closed defaults (no more unlimited loss):** `KillSwitch` and
  `PersistentKillSwitch` `daily_loss_limit` defaults changed from
  `float("inf")` to `None`; when unset, the gate applies a conservative hard
  cap of **2% of current equity** (`DEFAULT_DAILY_LOSS_PCT`). Explicit dollar
  limits still override.
- **Factory:** `AuditPort` now wired into `RiskService` (was unset in
  production), so rejections are recorded.
- **Proof through the real path** (`tests/test_cycle_risk_gate.py`): a real
  `RiskService` driven through a real `CycleExecutor` with a spy broker —
  oversized order and daily-loss-breach order both refuse with
  `place_market_order` **never called**; an in-limits order still reaches the
  broker. `grep` confirms the submission path was ungated before (`3c80c4f`,
  0 references) and is gated now.
- **Evidence:** `docs/evidence/2026-08-02_sprint24_risk_gate_submission_boundary.log`.
  Full suite `1282 passed, 1 skipped`; coverage 92.54%; black/isort/ruff/
  pyright clean.
- **Honest scope:** closes exactly one gap (order-level risk enforcement at the
  live boundary). Backtest realism, live-ops maturity, HA, and the rest of the
  OpenCode audit remain open and scheduled for larger work blocks.

### Sprint 23 (Real-data backtesting: unified Alpaca + Binance data foundation)

### Real-data backtesting (2026-08-02)
- **Unified, durable data model:** `HistoricalDataService` normalizes
  `AlpacaCollector` (crypto feed, `BTC/USD`) and `BinanceCollector`
  (`BTCUSDT`) into domain `Candle`s keyed by `uuid5("traderos://{source}/{symbol}")`;
  `SQLiteHistoricalCandleRepository` + migration `v007_historical_candles`
  (`UNIQUE(source, symbol, timeframe, ts)`) persist trusted bars for reuse.
  Fixed cache-read bug (cached rows key `ts`, not `timestamp`).
- **Backtest engine reality fixes:** indicators now include `sma_20/sma_50`,
  Bollinger bands, `atr_14` (strategies could never signal before), fills are
  counted into `total_trades`, and `mean_reversion` warm-up division-by-zero is
  guarded. Engine honestly reports flat ±2% BTC 1h data as no `moving_average_trend`
  edge while `volatility_breakout`/`mean_reversion` fill hundreds of trades.
- **CLI:** `backtest` gains `--source {synthetic,binance,alpaca}`, `--symbol`,
  `--timeframe`, `--candles`, `--no-cache`, and full metrics output.
- **Architecture:** collectors composed at the CLI layer; domain stays
  infrastructure-import-free (dependency-direction test enforces).
- **Evidence:** `docs/evidence/2026-08-02_sprint23_real_backtest_alpaca_binance.log`
  — live 1h fetch + identical cache-recall on both providers; CLI backtests
  fill trades on both. Full suite `1279 passed, 1 skipped`; coverage 92.56%.

### Sprint 22 (Postgres reproducibility — environment-independent CI signal)

### Postgres reproducibility programme (2026-08-02)
- **Root cause fixed (test-harness only, no `src/` changes):** an independent
  cold-environment audit against `d52f0bd` found 51 test errors, 100% from one
  cause (Postgres unreachable at `localhost:5433`, no skip guard) and zero
  application-logic defects. A short-timeout reachability probe now guards the
  Postgres-backed modules so they **skip** (honest reason, visibly not a pass)
  when no Postgres is reachable — and **run for real** when one is.
- **Guarded:** `tests/test_postgres_repositories.py`,
  `tests/test_observability_postgres.py`,
  `tests/test_observability_postgres_services.py`, and
  `TestV004Postgres` in `tests/test_migration_v004.py`
  (its sqlite tests still run without Postgres).
- **CI:** verified (not assumed) `ci.yml`'s `test` job provisions the Postgres
  service and documented it, so CI exercises the pass path, not the skip path.
- **Evidence (both environments, 0 failures/0 errors, only skips differ):**
  - WITH Postgres → `1274 passed, 1 skipped` (`docs/evidence/2026-08-02_postgres_with_pg.log`);
  - WITHOUT Postgres → `1219 passed, 56 skipped` (`docs/evidence/2026-08-02_postgres_without_pg.log`).
- **Governance:** merged `docs/engineering/AUDIT_GROUND_TRUTH.md` verbatim into
  canonical `docs/AUDIT_GROUND_TRUTH.md` (§7 delta + appendix), deleted the
  redundant copy, repointed internal links; `NEXT_STEPS_TO_COMPLETION.md`
  marks WP-N1 DONE, folds WP-N0, closes WP-N2.

### Sprint 21 (Order-Survivability: durable journal wire-up L1-L4)

### Order-Survivability Sprint (2026-08-02)
- **L1 — durable, idempotent order path**: new `infrastructure/journaled_broker.py`
  `JournaledBroker` persists intent before the broker (`CONFIRMED` on success),
  dedupes by a derived `uuid5` key, and replays the stored result on restart
  (no duplicate submit). Wired into LIVE mode via `factory.build_orchestrator`
  (best-effort). `journal.py` gained `get/update/count`.
- **L2 — restart drill**: `docs/evidence/2026-08-02_l2_restart_surprise_rehearsal.log`
  shows broker submit `0` on replay, intent drift blocking `can_accept_orders`,
  `unconfirmed_intent` mismatch surfaced. `MismatchType.UNCONFIRMED_INTENT` +
  `journal_pending` added to reconciliation.
- **L3 — runbook→CLI parity** (CLOSURE-14): `risk` (status/check/reset/kill/reconcile),
  `metrics` (snapshot/watch), `daemon start` alias, `audit verify`. All hands-on PASS.
- **L4 — last live-dependency drills (real network/Postgres, not fabricated)**:
  - **R-01 Binance live**: REST klines + live WS `@kline_1m` through the OT-004
    pipeline → PASS (`docs/evidence/2026-08-02_l4r01_binance_live.log`).
  - **R-02 Postgres crash**: `traderos-pg-test` crashed → boundary failed closed
    (`connection-refused`) → restarted healthy → marker row survived → PASS
    (`..._l4r02_postgres_crash_drill.log`).
- **Gate**: full suite **1274 passed, 1 skipped**, coverage **92.83%**; ruff 0;
  black/isort unchanged; pyright strict clean.
- **Honest residual**: L5 (real-money pilot + switch) intentionally gated on
  explicit operator funding/approval — not fabricated.

### Sprint 20 (Programme Ω — First genuine execution evidence)

### Programme Ω (2026-08-02)
- **Bootstrap fix**: `Config.load()` now auto-creates runtime dirs (`data_dir`, `exports_dir`, `db_path` dir), so `pilot dry-run` works from a genuinely fresh checkout (`test_load_creates_missing_db_directory` regression test).
- **First real execution evidence** (all logged under `docs/evidence/2026-08-02_*.log`, secrets redacted):
  - **Alpaca paper dry-run rehearsal** against a **real paper account**: connected with `alpaca-py 0.43.5`, reconciled broker state (`can_accept_orders=True`, real balance 100,000), operator workflow `READY` with live execution disabled (`dry_run=True`), exit **0**.
  - **Backup → restore drill**: SHA-256 round-trip equal (`b91b07a…`), marker row preserved, `PRAGMA integrity_check` ok.
  - **Migration rollback drill**: schema 6 → 3 → 6 with integrity `ok` at each step.
- **Real defects surfaced & fixed by the genuine run**:
  - `AlpacaBrokerAdapter.get_open_orders()` used an incompatible `get_orders(status="open")` call → now `GetOrdersRequest(QueryOrderStatus.OPEN)` (alpaca-py 0.43.5 API); test mock + assertion updated.
  - `factory.py` built `PaperTradingService` only in `PAPER` mode, so the LIVE-mode operator workflow hard-failed at the paper gate; now built for `LIVE` too (harmless under `dry_run=True`), letting the rehearsal complete.
- **Governance**, evidence-only: `NEXT_STEPS_TO_COMPLETION.md` Ω trackers → DONE; `FINISH_LINE_DASHBOARD.md` Deployment Readiness 72→74 + PRI note; `AUDIT_GROUND_TRUTH.md` §10 delta.
- **Gate**: full suite **1266 passed, 1 skipped**; `ruff check .` 0 errors; black/isort/pyright strict clean.
- **Honest residual (still open, not fabricated)**: real-money live pilot, Binance live (R-01), Postgres failure drill (R-02), durable journal wire-up (CLOSURE-12), runbook→CLI parity (CLOSURE-14).

### Sprint 19 (Engineering Closure & Code Freeze Preparation)

### Engineering Closure pass (2026-08-02)
- **Build green**: installed missing `prometheus-client` (pinned) so `/metrics` returns **200** (was 501); fixed the previously failing `test_health_and_metrics_stay_open`.
- **Lint green**: fixed **22 ruff errors** — 5 in `src` (E501) + 17 in `tests` (SIM102/SIM117/RUF059/F841/PLW1510/BLE001). Introduced a `_CYCLE_EXCEPTIONS` alias in `cycle_executor.py`/`daemon_controller.py` to deduplicate the repeated exception tuple. Black/isort reformat of 6 flagged files.
- **Full suite**: **1266 passed**, coverage **93.62%**; `make ci` green (ruff, black, isort, pyright strict, pytest).
- **Security measured**: `pip-audit` 0 known vulnerabilities; `bandit -r src/traderos -lll` 0 High (Medium = known B608 f-string-SQL false positives).
- **Dead code removed**: deleted dead stubs `DaemonController._is_market_hours` (always `True`) and `DaemonController._drain_open_orders` (fake audit event).
- **Release docs**: replaced aspirational placeholders with verified `ENGINEERING_CLOSURE_AUDIT.md`, honest `FINISH_LINE_DASHBOARD.md`, `ENGINEERING_CLOSURE_REPORT.md`; delta sections added to `AUDIT_GROUND_TRUTH.md` and `STRATEGIC_COMPLETION_BLUEPRINT.md`.
- **Closure backlog opened (no speculative features)**: live-connectivity drills, replay wiring (CLOSURE-12), runbook→CLI parity, controlled pilot.

### Sprint 18 (Coverage to 91.8% + Production Security Hardening)

### WP-1 — Close the coverage gap (86.80% → 91.82%)
- **Layer 1a — flagged modules to unit coverage**: `market_hours_engine` 38% → 98%, `webhook_notifier` 43% → 84%, `leader_election` 58% → 97%, `message_queue` 67% → 100%, `interfaces/api/main.py` 33% → 94%.
- **Layer 1b — PostgreSQL-backed coverage** against the `traderos-pg-test` container (port 5433, `POSTGRES_TEST_DSN`): `observability_postgres` 35% → 99%, `postgres/base` 39% → 94%, `postgres/signals` 51% → 100%, `postgres/trades` 41% → 100%.
- **Layer 1c — mop-up**: `sqlite/knowledge` 55% → 100% (incl. `get_neighbors` BFS), `in_memory/indicators` 67% → 100%, `v004` migration 69% → 100%, `migration_utils` 27% → 100%.
- **Latent bugs fixed by the new tests**:
  - `webhook_notifier.py` — `retry_with_backoff` raises `ServiceError`, which was never caught; webhook failures now surface as logged warnings instead of leaking.
  - `market_hours_engine.py` — 24h sessions mis-handled when `open == close`; `FOREX_24_5`/`CRYPTO_24_7` conflated by structural `==` on the frozen dataclass (now identity checks); `next_open` never advanced past "after close" / weekends.
- New test files: `test_market_hours_engine.py`, `test_webhook_notifier.py`, `test_observability_postgres_services.py`, `test_postgres_repositories.py`, `test_migration_v004.py`.

### WP-2 — Production security hardening (fail-closed posture)
- **`infrastructure/security_policy.py`** (new): `TRADEROS_ENV=production` now requires API keys and TLS and forbids CORS allow-all; development/CI stay open-by-default and frictionless. `SecurityPolicyError` is raised on violation; `check_security_posture()` produces a machine-readable `SecurityReport`.
- **API entrypoint fails closed**: `interfaces/api/main.py` refuses to start the server in production until keys + TLS are configured.
- **`traderos security audit`** CLI: reports auth/TLS/CORS/secret-rotation posture per environment, exits non-zero when insufficient (evidence for the pilot gate).

### Verification
- **1201 tests passing, 1 skipped** (full suite), **91.82% coverage** (threshold 70%), **ruff 0 errors** and **pyright 0 errors** on all changed files. Sprint report: `docs/sprints/SPRINT_18.md`.

### Sprint 17 (Pilot Readiness — Order Surface, Service Wiring, Security Hardening, Pilot CLI)

### WP-2 — Order surface
- **Broker ABC** (`domain/adapters/broker_adapter.py`): `place_stop_order`, `place_trailing_stop_order`, `modify_order`.
- **Alpaca** (`infrastructure/alpaca_broker.py`): all three implemented via `replace_order_by_id` (qty → int, prices rounded).
- **Paper broker** (`domain/services/paper_trading_service.py`): stateful adapter (`_positions`, `_open_orders`, `_order_seq`, `_apply_fill`, `_record_order`); stop/trailing stops become real guarded limit orders (trigger only when `market_price is not None`).
- **`OrderStatus.MODIFIED`** (`domain/services/execution_service.py`); **rate-limiter** pass-throughs for the three new methods.

### WP-3 — Service wiring
- **BACKTEST mode** now runs enabled strategies through `BacktestingService.run` on fetched/synthetic candles; per-strategy `run_manifest` + `backtest.complete` events; missing service records a `ServiceError` instead of crashing the cycle.
- **Regime + breakout analysis** run each cycle and publish `cycle.analysis` events (`payload: {market_id, regime, breakout_events}`).
- **Trade evidence**: post-fill hook creates knowledge-graph market/strategy nodes with `trades_in`/`has_strategy` edges and a `research.create_observation` entry.
- **Factory** wires in-memory `KnowledgeGraphService` + `ResearchService` (all five research repos) and wraps the broker as `GuardrailedBroker(RateLimitedBroker(broker))`.

### WP-4 — Security hardening
- **`GuardrailedBroker`** (`infrastructure/order_guardrail.py`, enabled by default): rejects `qty < TRADEROS_MIN_ORDER_QTY` (default 1.0) or notional > `TRADEROS_MAX_ORDER_NOTIONAL` (default 500.0); rejections return `FillResult(..., "rejected", reason)` so they count against the kill-switch failure counter. Covers market/limit/stop/trailing/modify-qty.
- **CORS**: `CORS_ORIGINS` now defaults to `""` (deny-all browser CORS); explicit `*` or comma-separated origins to enable.
- `docs/runbooks/CONTROLLED_PILOT.md` gains an **Order-Size Guardrails** section with pilot values.

### WP-5 — Pilot readiness
- **`traderos pilot readiness`** — runs the live-readiness gate (human table or `--json`), exits 0 only when ready; **`traderos pilot dry-run`** rehearses the operator workflow end to end with `dry_run=True`, driving the state machine from its current step, skipping strategy promotion (operator decision), stopping at the first failing gate.
- **`docs/runbooks/PILOT_READINESS.md`** — readiness checks, dry-run flow, six go/no-go gates, controlled-live procedure, exit criteria.
- CLI tests for both pilot subcommands.

### Verification
- **1060 tests passing, 1 skipped** (full suite), **86.80% coverage** (threshold 70%), **ruff 0 errors** and **pyright 0 errors** on all changed files. Sprint report: `docs/sprints/SPRINT_17.md`.

### Sprint 16 (Programme C — Auth, Observability, Dashboard, Live Verification, Ops)

### WP-3 — Auth / RBAC
- **API-key authentication** (`infrastructure/auth.py` + `interfaces/api/security.py`): `TRADEROS_ADMIN_API_KEY`/`TRADEROS_OPERATOR_API_KEY`/`TRADEROS_VIEWER_API_KEY` (legacy `TRADEROS_API_KEY` → admin). Open-by-default: enforcement activates only when keys are configured.
- **Role-scoped dependencies** `require_read`/`require_operate`/`require_admin` applied to every protected route; `GET /v1/auth/me` returns the authenticated principal. Health, `/metrics`, and the `/dashboard` static mount stay open.

### WP-4 — Observability
- **`EventBroker`** (`interfaces/api/events.py`): thread-safe bounded buffer (maxlen 50, drop-oldest) with blocking get; `get_broker`/`reset_broker`/`publish_event`.
- **`/v1/events` SSE** endpoint: snapshot-first, 15 s keepalives, clean unsubscribe; testable `operator.event_stream(...)` async generator factored out of the route. Fixed a stream-blocking bug (`to_thread(sub.get, timeout=...)` → `sub.get(True, 15)`).
- **Kill-switch alerting** via `NotificationLevel.CRITICAL`/`WARNING` with `metadata={"source": "operator_api"}`.
- **Binance gating**: real crypto feed only when `data_collection.binance.enabled` and the collector is installed (default `enabled: false`); `server.reset_rate_limiter()` for deterministic tests.

### WP-1 — Dashboard
- **Static SPA** mounted at `/dashboard/` (root `/` 307-redirects there): API-key sign-in, live SSE event log, workflow advance, kill-switch, strategy catalog (create/enable/disable/promote/archive), positions/orders/trades tables, equity-curve canvas.
- **Packaging**: `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` ships `*.html`/`*.js`/`*.css` in wheels.

### WP-2 — Live-trading verification / dry-run
- **`LiveReadinessService`** (`domain/services/live_readiness.py`): verdict over broker connectivity/balance, data feeds, kill-switch, live preflight, operator-session state; exposed via `GET /v1/live/check`.
- **Workflow dry-run**: `dry_run: bool` on workflow advance lets operators rehearse the `controlled_live` transition without enabling live execution (`live_execution_enabled` surfaced in the verdict and gate result).

### WP-5 — Ops polish
- **`tests/conftest.py`** autouse rate-limiter reset → randomized-order full suite is deterministic.
- Lint/typecheck cleanup: duplicate `WorkflowAdvanceRequest` fields removed (PIE794), unused imports removed (F401), redundant comparison simplified (reportUnnecessaryComparison).

### Verification
- **1031 tests passing, 1 skipped** (full suite, repeated runs), **86.80% coverage** (threshold 70%), **ruff 0 errors** and **pyright 0 errors** on all changed files. Sprint report: `docs/sprints/SPRINT_16.md`.

### Sprint 15 (Deployment, Railway, Maintenance/Release)

### Deployment
- **Compose stack** (`docker-compose.yml` rewritten): `postgres` (16-alpine, healthchecked), `traderos-api` (PG-backed, healthchecked via `/v1/healthz`), `traderos-daemon` (paper mode, 60s interval), `postgres-test` (test profile). `docker compose config -q` clean.
- **PostgreSQL migrations-on-boot**: fresh-PG path fixed end-to-end — v001 `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`, `BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE`, obsolete legacy `strategies`/`backtest_results` tables removed; v006 `_serial(backend)` + unified legacy strategy rebuild; `db check` cursor fix. Fresh PG migrates to Schema version 6.
- **Railway**: Dockerfile `VOLUME` removed (unsupported by Railway) in favor of `railway.toml` volumes (`/app/data`, `/app/exports`), healthcheck `/v1/healthz`, `startCommand`. API binds `$PORT` (default 8000). Deployment live at `traderos-production.up.railway.app` with `Postgres-gKbz` service and `DATABASE_URL` wired.
- **CI `deploy-check` job**: compose validation, fresh-PG migration smoke (Schema version 6), API container health smoke.

### Maintenance / Release
- **Single version source**: `pyproject.toml` (`1.1.0`) is authoritative; dead `VERSION` file removed; `settings.yaml` synced; CI `version-check` job guards drift.
- **`release.yml`**: tag-triggered (assert tag == package version, full test gate, sdist/wheel, GHCR image with semver tags, GitHub Release from CHANGELOG section).
- **Secret rotation**: `SecretRotator` (env provider) wired into the orchestrator lifecycle and surfaced in `get_status()`.
- **Retention**: `order_events` journal purged via `applied_at` in `purge_old_entries`; file logging uses `RotatingFileHandler` (`LOG_MAX_BYTES`, `LOG_BACKUP_COUNT`).

### Sprint 14 (Programme C — Commercial Surface)

### C2 — Enforced operator workflow
- **`OperatorWorkflow`** (`domain/services/operator_workflow.py`): 10-step canonical lifecycle (start → preflight → broker_check → market_data_check → paper_trading → performance_review → strategy_promotion → controlled_live → shutdown → session_report). Strict ordering: only the immediate next step or a re-run of the current one; out-of-order attempts raise `WorkflowError`.
- **`OperatorSessionService`** (`domain/services/operator_session.py`): every step gated on a real check — preflight verdict, broker balance + state reconciliation, market-data feed count, running paper sessions, catalog comparison ranking, strategy promotion, live-mode preflight, paper shutdown. Failing gates return `ok=False` (no advance); successful transitions are persisted through `OperatorWorkflowRepository`.

### C3 — Strategy catalog
- **`StrategyCatalogService`** (`domain/services/strategy_management.py`): seeded built-in templates (moving_average_trend, volatility_breakout, mean_reversion), versioned strategies, lifecycle (draft → active → disabled/archived, single promoted), clone, backtest comparison ranking, review.
- Execution loop consumes only enabled strategies via the `enabled_strategies` callable bound in the orchestrator.

### C1 — Operator API
- **`register_operator_endpoints`** (`interfaces/api/operator.py`), served under `/v1`: read panels (positions, orders, trades, portfolio, equity-curve, pnl, kill-switch, preflight, readiness, workflow, strategies, review) and write actions (kill-switch engage/disengage, workflow advance, strategy create/compare/enable/disable/promote/archive/clone). Error semantics: 400/404/409/501.

### C4 — Session reports
- **`SessionReportService`** (`domain/services/session_report.py`): immutable session snapshot (workflow state, transition log, portfolio, positions, trades, catalog + promoted strategy, risk, duration) with JSON and Markdown exports.
- Endpoints: `GET /v1/reports/session` and `?fmt=markdown`.

### C5/C6 — Documentation and productization
- **`docs/engineering/FINISH_LINE_DASHBOARD.md`** (new): authoritative operator-surface design doc (workflow semantics, endpoint map, error semantics, catalog, report contract, DoD).
- **`README.md`**: productized entry point — new features, operator curl examples, documentation table.

### Sprint 13 (Programme B — Operational Trust)

### OT-001 — Binance WebSocket transport (thin; live connectivity = declared risk)
- **`BinanceStreamTransport`** (`infrastructure/market_stream.py`): subscribes to `<symbol>@aggTrade`, parses frames, yields normalized raw ticks. Pure `parse_trade_frame` (handles combined-stream envelopes + raw `aggTrade`/`trade`, skips acks/klines), `build_subscription_frame`, `binance_stream_symbol`. Connector injected for offline tests; default lazily imports `websockets`. Live connect is **not** claimed — no network in this environment.

### OT-002 — Durable idempotency/replay + restart recovery
- **`OrderEventJournal`** (`infrastructure/journal.py`, `v005` migration): durable `order_events` table; preloads processed IDs at startup; `replay()` republishes pending events.
- **`DurableRunManifest`** (`infrastructure/run_manifest.py`): sqlite-backed run history + `detect_unclean_shutdown`; `DaemonController._detect_crash`/`_recover_from_crash` run post-crash reconciliation only after an unclean shutdown.

### OT-003 — Order-event side effects atomic via outbox
- **`OrderEventEngine`**: journal record committed **before** persist/publish; `mark_published` only after a successful publish; publish failures stay pending and replay exactly once.

### OT-004 — Tick validation + timestamp normalization
- **`validate_tick`/`normalize_timestamp`/`InvalidTickError`** (`market_stream.py`): finite positive price, non-negative quantity, symbol checks, ms-vs-seconds auto-detection, stale/future rejection; malformed frames skipped, counted, never treated as a transport outage.

### OT-005 — ACKNOWLEDGED open-order parity + Postgres migration path (H7)
- **`OPEN_TRADE_STATUSES`** in `domain/entities/trade.py` used by in-memory/sqlite/postgres `get_open()`.
- **`migration_utils.execute`** cursor routing; version marker deleted **before** `down()`; `v002–v005` backend-aware + idempotent; `v004` guards a missing `trades` table on fresh PG.

### OT-006/OT-011 — Concurrency safety
- **Per-trade locks** in `OrderEventEngine` (64/32-thread tests: exactly-one acceptance). **`ThreadSafeSQLiteConnection`** (`infrastructure/database/connection.py`) serializes every statement/cursor; `_connect_sqlite` honors an explicit `Config.db_path` (env must not shadow it).

### OT-007/OT-008 — Candle robustness + bounded retention
- **`CandleAggregator`**: epoch buckets, `flush`/`flush_all`/`flush_stale`, late-tick rejection + counter, bounded closed-bucket deque. **`ReplayRecorder`**: maxlen deque + drop counter; latency buffer trimmed.

### OT-009 — Duplicate/overflow fill guards
- **`_validate_fill`**: rejects non-finite/≤0 quantity, quantity > order quantity, non-finite/≤0 price.

### OT-010 — Bounded health + liveness/readiness
- **`run_with_timeout`** (`infrastructure/health.py`); `GET /v1/healthz` (liveness, no orchestrator build) and `GET /v1/health` (readiness, bounded by `ORCHESTRATOR_READY_TIMEOUT`, 503 degraded on timeout) in `interfaces/api/server.py`.

### Regression surface
- **`tests/test_programme_b_operational_trust.py` (new, 51 tests)** covering all 11 findings.

### Docs
- **`docs/engineering/OPERATIONAL_TRUST_MATRIX.md`**, **`docs/engineering/RECOVERY_TRUTH.md`**, **`docs/engineering/FAILURE_INJECTION_REPORT.md`** (new); MEP §26 and blueprint §13/§14 updated. Sprint report: `docs/sprints/SPRINT_13.md`.

### Verification
- **864 tests passing, 0 failures**, **83.77% coverage** (threshold 70%), **ruff clean on `src/traderos`**, **pyright 0 errors**.
- **Declared, non-fabricated remaining risks:** R-01 live Binance WS connectivity (no network/`websockets` in sandbox); R-02 live Alpaca/Postgres behavior (no credentials/server). Both are contract/structure-tested only.

### Sprint 12 (Programme A — Core Loop Integrity)

### D1/D2 — Fills now create positions; paper-broker fills no longer crash
- **`CycleExecutor.run()` routes every accepted fill through `PortfolioService.fill_trade`** (`application/cycle_executor.py`): the only method that creates/updates `Position` rows. Previously the executor's `open_trade → submit → fill → update_trade` sequence left the position repo untouched (D1).
- **`fill_trade` handles the no-external-order-id case** (`domain/services/portfolio_service.py`): a PENDING trade without an order id is auto-submitted as `auto-{trade.id}` before filling, fixing the `PENDING→FILLED` `InvalidTradeTransitionError` caused by `PaperBrokerAdapter` returning `order_id=""` (D2). The raw state machine still rejects `PENDING→FILLED`; the fix routes *through* it.

### D3 — `size_position` returns shares, not dollars
- **`PortfolioService.size_position(cash, confidence, price)` now returns share quantity** (`round(cash * alloc / price, 8)`; `price <= 0 → 0.0`). Both callers (`cycle_executor.py`, `paper_trading_service.py`) pass `price=close_price`.

### D4 — Realized PnL reaches the kill switches
- **`PortfolioService` gains a `risk_service` field; `close_position` reports realized PnL** via `risk_service.record_realized_pnl`, which forwards to `KillSwitch` and `PersistentKillSwitch`. Wired in the composition root (`application/factory.py`).

### D5/D8/D9 — Strategies can fire; real market data and ATR reach the cycle
- **Cycle supplies the full real indicator set** to every strategy's `MarketState`: `sma_20/50`, `bb_upper_20/lower_20`, `atr_14`, and real `high`/`low`/`volume` from `candles[-1]` — so all registered built-in strategies can evaluate. Fallbacks to fabricated values occur only when candles are empty.
- **`assess_trade` receives the real computed ATR** instead of `close_price * 0.01`.

### D6 — Cycle metrics are truthful
- **`cycles.completed` counted exactly once per cycle** (was per-strategy); **`cycle.duration_ms` records the measured duration** (was ≈ 0).

### D7 — Double preflight retained by design
- Reclassified as **by-design** (TOCTOU re-check required by `test_preflight_execution_integration.py`). No code change.

### Regression surface
- **`tests/test_core_loop_invariants.py` (new, 11 tests):** pins invariants I1/I2/I3/I5/I6/I8/I9 and the D1–D6/D8/D9 closes.
- **`tests/test_cycle_executor.py`, `tests/test_portfolio_service.py`:** updated for realistic mocks and share-semantics sizing.
- **Docs:** `docs/engineering/CORE_LOOP_TRUTH.md` (execution graph + defect register), `docs/engineering/CORE_LOOP_EVIDENCE.md` (per-defect proofs), `docs/AUDIT_GROUND_TRUTH.md` committed.

### Verification
- **843 tests passing, 0 failures** (`python3 -m pytest -q -p no:randomly`), **84.63% coverage** (baseline 84.42%), **ruff clean on `src/traderos` + touched tests**, **pyright 0 errors**. Sprint report: `docs/sprints/SPRINT_12.md`.

### Sprint 11 (Programme Ω — Operational Verification)

### Ω.1 — Audit Integrity (GATE 1)
- **`verify_chain()` content-integrity fix** (`infrastructure/audit.py`, `observability.py`, `observability_postgres.py`): All 3 backends now recompute each entry's expected hash from field values and compare against stored hash, plus verify previous_hash link integrity. Tampering with any of the 7 auditable fields (id, action, actor, resource, detail, timestamp, previous_hash) is detected.
- **Six-field mutation tests**: Individual mutation tests for action, actor, resource, detail, timestamp, previous_hash in both InMemory and SQLite backends. Single-entry and broken-link tamper tests.
- **Multi-seed PYTHONHASHSEED verification**: SHA256 hash computation proven identical across seeds 0,1,42,12345,99999 via subprocess isolation.
- **ADR-008 updated**: Status changed to "Accepted", verify_chain() behavior now accurately documented, hash recomputation verified in all backends.

### Ω.2 — Broker Reconciliation (GATE 2)
- **Full 10-mismatch detection engine** (`domain/services/broker_state_reconciliation_service.py`): MismatchType enum with broker-only/local-only positions and orders, quantity mismatch, price mismatch, stale snapshots, duplicate broker state, broker failures, unknown state.
- **Each mismatch wired to KillSwitch** (severity >= 2 increments consecutive_failures), **health** (report_unhealthy per mismatch), **audit** (reconciliation.mismatch entry), **metrics** (per-mismatch-type counter + reconciliation.mismatches total).
- **DaemonController** passes local state to reconciliation, records audit entries and metric counters for all mismatch types.
- **14 tests** (5 legacy updated + 9 new: all 10 mismatch types proven via integration test).

### Ω.2b — PreflightService (GATE 2b)
- **PreflightService wired into production path**: Created in `build_orchestrator()` factory with audit + broker_reconciliation + kill_switch dependencies; passed through TradingOrchestrator to both DaemonController (as pre_cycle_hook) and CycleExecutor (as pre-submission gate).
- **Every refusal condition independently prevents live order submission**: PreflightService.check() called at start of each signal's trading loop in CycleExecutor.run() before broker.place_market_order().
- **Spy/mock tests proving broker.send is never called when preflight fails**: 4 integration tests verifying that preflight failures (general, blocked reconciliation, engaged kill switch) all prevent broker.place_market_order from being invoked.

### Ω.4 — Operational Recovery
- **Timed backup/restore tests**: Backup and restore both complete within 5-second SLO.
- **Crash recovery drill tests**: Simulated crash with order reconciliation, kill-switch reset after recovery, broker outage recovery, preflight re-pass after recovery.
- **Reconciliation drill tests**: Full reconciliation cycle with matched state, full recovery after mismatch fix.
- **recover_from_crash()** updated: accepts local_trades and broker_orders_state parameters for actual state reconciliation.

### Rate-limiter wrapper (Programme C)
- **Rate-limited broker adapter** (`infrastructure/broker_rate_limiter.py`): Flagged `BrokerAdapter` proxy. Disabled by default (`BROKER_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`).

### Operations runbooks (Programme C)
- **Operations runbook**, **Controlled-pilot parameters**, **Cold incident drill**, **Deployment rollback drill**.

### L1 — Healthy-Overwrite Bug Fix
- **`_handle_reconciliation_result` fix** (`daemon_controller.py`): Removed `report_healthy("broker_reconciliation")` from mismatch branch. When mismatches exist, only `report_unhealthy` is called. `report_healthy` only called from the no-mismatch path.

### L2 — Stale-Snapshot Severity Raised
- **`MismatchType.STALE_SNAPSHOT` severity 1→2** (`broker_state_reconciliation_service.py:217`): Now trips KillSwitch, increments metric counter, and blocks order acceptance.

### L3 — PostgreSQL Audit Chain Ordering Fix
- **`id_seq SERIAL` column added** to `audit_log` table (`v002_observability.py`): PostgreSQL `verify_chain()` was using `ORDER BY id` on UUID text column, which sorts alphabetically not by insertion order. Fixed all 4 ORDER BY clauses in `observability_postgres.py` to use `id_seq`.
- **8 PostgreSQL mutation tests** (`test_observability_postgres.py`): All 6 field mutations (action, actor, resource, detail, timestamp, previous_hash) + broken link + untampered chain. Fresh-connection fixture eliminates cursor-visibility races. 8/8 pass.

### L4 — Dependency Direction Fitness Test
- **Committed fixture** (`_fixture_broken_domain.py`): Deliberate infrastructure import in domain proves AST checker catches violations. Tested in `test_dependency_direction.py`.

### L5 — 60-Assertion Effect Matrix
- **`test_reconciliation_effects.py`**: Parametrizes all 10 mismatch types × 6 effects (detection, health, kill-switch, audit, metrics, notifications) + 3 regression tests. ~63 assertions.

### L6 — 10 Preflight Refusal Tests + TOCTOU
- **Expanded 4→10 tests** (`test_preflight_execution_integration.py`): All refusal conditions + TOCTOU race test.
- **TOCTOU protection** (`cycle_executor.py`): Re-checks preflight right before `broker.place_market_order()`.

### L7 — Operational Recovery Logs
- **Backup/restore logging** (`backup.py`): `logger.info()` with timestamps for `backup_sqlite()` and `restore_sqlite()`.
- **3 log-capture tests** (`test_operational_recovery.py::TestRunbookExecution`): Backup log, restore log, full workflow with data verification.

### L8 — Clean Ship
- **Lint zero**: `ruff check src/traderos/` — 0 errors.
- **All tests green**: 832 passing, 0 failures (was 801 + 1 pre-existing failure now fixed).
- **`TradeStatus.ACKNOWLEDGED`** + `Trade.acknowledge()` added for Sprint 9 test compatibility.

### Governance
- **ADR-008**: Updated to Accepted status, verify_chain() behavior now matches implementation exactly.
- **SPRINT_11.md**: Programme Ω complete — all 9 Codex rejection points resolved across 8 layers.
- **832 tests passing, 0 failures, 0 lint errors.**

### Sprint 9

### Added
- Provider-neutral streaming market data pipeline with bounded backpressure, heartbeat, latency, clock-drift observation, reconnect handling, candle aggregation and replay recording.
- Enriched event context and deterministic idempotent order-event engine.
- Alpaca health/error classification, account synchronization, buying-power verification and order modification support.
- Sprint 9 tests, benchmark, architecture documentation and live market infrastructure report.

### WP-7.1 — Architecture Fitness & Risk-Path Integrity
- **ADR-007 ratified**: Manual-reset-only circuit breaker replaces cooldown-based auto-reset. `can_trade()` returns `False` unconditionally while circuit is open; only explicit `reset()` clears the breaker. Preserves failure evidence for post-mortem per Constitution §2 Principle 2.
- **Dependency direction enforcement**: `tests/architecture/test_dependency_direction.py` uses AST walk to verify domain/ never imports from infrastructure/. Catches violations at CI time. Includes a deliberately-broken fixture to prove the check can fail.
- **NotifierPort protocol** (`domain/ports.py`): Port for out-of-band notification delivery (webhook, Slack, etc.). Domain services now depend only on the protocol.
- **WebhookNotifier adapter** (`infrastructure/notifiers/webhook_notifier.py`): Extracts webhook POST logic (with retry) from notification_service.py into the infrastructure layer where it belongs.
- **Dependency rule restored**: `notification_service.py` no longer imports `retry_with_backoff` from `infrastructure.retry`. Webhook delivery delegates to injected `NotifierPort`.
- **KillSwitch metrics**: `RiskService` accepts optional `MetricsPort`; kill-switch trips increment the `circuit_breaker.tripped` counter for operational visibility.
- **Manual-reset-only circuit breaker**: `KillSwitch` and `PersistentKillSwitch` both enforce manual-reset semantics. Removed dead `circuit_open_until` field and cooldown-based auto-reset logic from `PersistentKillSwitch`.
- **Coverage threshold**: `pyproject.toml` `fail_under = 70` documented as MEP §17 interim gate with path to 90%.

### WP-10.1 — Audit Chain: SHA256 over Canonical Serialization
- **ADR-008 ratified**: Replaced non-deterministic `hash()` with `hashlib.sha256()` over canonical JSON serialization. Fixes pipe-delimiter ambiguity bug. Pre-fix chain boundary documented — old entries not retroactively rehashed.
- **Shared `compute_audit_hash()`** in `infrastructure/audit.py` used by all three backends (InMemory, SQLite, PostgreSQL).

### WP-10.2 — Broker State Reconciliation
- **`BrokerStateReconciliationService`** (`domain/services/broker_state_reconciliation_service.py`): Periodically reconciles broker positions and open orders against local state. Blocks order acceptance until first successful startup reconciliation.
- **Reconciliation failures trip KillSwitch**: `record_failure()` called on each error, NOT just logged.
- **`get_open_orders()`** added to `BrokerPort` protocol and all adapters (`PaperBrokerAdapter`, `AlpacaBrokerAdapter`).
- **DaemonController** runs startup + periodic reconciliation; skips trading cycles when `can_accept_orders` is False.

### WP-10.3 — Preflight Go/No-Go Gate
- **`PreflightService`** (`domain/services/preflight_service.py`): Composes audit-chain verification + reconciliation freshness + kill-switch state + live-mode confirmation into a single `PreflightVerdict`.
- **`PreflightVerdict`**: Named tuple with `passed`, `checks` dict, `failures` list, and `timestamp`. Truthy on pass, falsy on fail.
- **Live mode gate**: Requires `LIVE_TRADING_CONFIRMED=true` environment variable as explicit confirmation beyond basic env-var presence.

- **750 tests passing at 81%+ coverage.**

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- **Production Readiness Programme (Sprint 7):** Complete production hardening across 6 phases.

### Phase 1 — Production Blockers (6 items)
- **HTTPS:** `SSL_KEYFILE`/`SSL_CERTFILE` env vars wired to uvicorn in `main.py`.
- **Secure CORS:** `CORS_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated); defaults to `*` for local dev.
- **CI security gates:** Removed `|| true` from `pip-audit` and `bandit` steps.
- **Domain exception adoption:** Replaced `RuntimeError`/`ValueError` with `ServiceError`/`InfrastructureError`/`ConfigError` in `retry.py`, `alpaca_broker.py`, `config_loader.py`, `notification_service.py`.
- **Startup validation:** `validate` CLI command; daemon calls `Config.validate()` before run loop.
- **Dependency hygiene:** Stale `requirements.txt` deleted; `pyproject.toml` is sole source of truth.

### Phase 2 — PostgreSQL Production Database
- `DATABASE_URL` env var for runtime database backend selection.
- `psycopg2-binary` as optional `postgres` dependency.
- Database connection factory (`connection.py`) returns `sqlite3.Connection` or psycopg2 connection.
- DB-agnostic migrations: all 3 migrations accept `backend="sqlite"` param, emit appropriate DDL (`SERIAL` vs `AUTOINCREMENT`, `ON CONFLICT` vs `INSERT OR IGNORE`).
- `PostgresRepository[T]` base class mirroring `SQLiteRepository[T]` with `%s` placeholders.
- PostgreSQL observability services: `PostgresAuditService`, `PostgresMetricsService`, `PostgresHealthService`, `PostgresManifestService`.
- Factory dispatches to Postgres repos/services when `DATABASE_URL` is set.

### Phase 3 — Observability
- `prometheus-client` as optional `monitoring` dependency.
- `PrometheusMetricsService` wrapping `prometheus_client.Counter`/`Gauge`/`Histogram`.
- Prometheus `/metrics` scrape endpoint (standard exposition format).
- Structured JSON logging via `JsonFormatter` + `setup_json_logging()`.
- HTTP request metrics middleware (counters + duration histograms).

### Phase 4 — API Hardening
- In-memory sliding-window rate limiter (`RateLimiter`) with `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` env var.
- Rate limiting middleware returns 429 + `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header.
- `/metrics` endpoint exempted from API key auth (Prometheus scraping standard).

### Phase 5 — Deployment
- Dockerfile updated to Python 3.14-slim with all extras (`api`, `alpaca`, `postgres`, `monitoring`).
- `railway.json` for Railway deployment with health check path.
- `nixpacks.toml` as alternative build config.
- CI pipeline upgraded to Python 3.14 with all extras.

### Phase 6 — Verification
- PrometheusMetricsService unit tests (counter, gauge, snapshot, timing).
- RateLimiter unit tests (within-limit, over-limit, remaining, key isolation).
- Database connection tests (backend resolution, ImportError for missing psycopg2).
- API integration tests for `/metrics` endpoint and rate limit headers.
- **666 tests passing at 86% coverage.**

### New files
- `src/traderos/infrastructure/database/connection.py`
- `src/traderos/infrastructure/monitoring.py`
- `src/traderos/infrastructure/rate_limiter.py`
- `src/traderos/infrastructure/observability_postgres.py`
- `src/traderos/infrastructure/repositories/postgres/`
- `railway.json`, `nixpacks.toml`
- `tests/test_monitoring.py`, `tests/test_rate_limiter.py`, `tests/test_database_connection.py`

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- **Post-merge Polish (Phases 0-3):** `assert`→`RuntimeError` in production code, version unification, MIT LICENSE, `.env.example`. Full README + CONTRIBUTING docs. Deleted 5 unused CLI/visualization files. CI/CD with pip-audit + bandit security job, Docker build/push to GHCR.
- **Coverage Layers (A-E):** `db_manager.py` (48%→89%), `observability.py` (63%→99%), `binance_collector.py` (50%→93%), `cycle_executor.py` (63%→76%), `daemon_controller.py` (63%→94%).
- **API v1 polish:** All routes grouped under `/v1/` prefix via `APIRouter`. Consistent error envelope `{"error": {"code": N, "message": "..."}}`. Request logging middleware (method, path, status, duration).
- 622 tests passing at 89% coverage.

### Changed
- **API routes now under `/v1/`:** `/v1/health`, `/v1/strategies`, `/v1/strategies/{name}`, `/v1/backtest`, `/v1/orchestrator/start`, `/v1/orchestrator/stop`, `/v1/orchestrator/status`, `/v1/papertrade/session`, `/v1/papertrade/sessions`, `/v1/audit`, `/v1/metrics`, `/v1/manifest`.
- **Error format:** 40x and 50x errors now return `{"error": {"code": N, "message": "..."}}` instead of `{"detail": "..."}`.

## [0.8.0] - v1 Readiness: Architecture Hardening

### Added
- **Domain port protocols:** `EventBusPort`, `HealthPort`, `AuditPort`, `MetricsPort`, `ManifestPort` defined in `domain/ports.py` with structural typing. Application layer now depends on protocols instead of concrete infrastructure.
- **SPRINT_6.md** documents the v1 readiness sprint plan.
- **Layer 10 — Production Hardening:**
  - **Retry with backoff:** `infrastructure/retry.py` — exponential backoff with jitter, max 3 attempts, applied to Alpaca broker order submission and notification webhook.
  - **Data archival:** `infrastructure/archiver.py` — `purge_old_entries()` deletes rows older than 90 days from 5 SQLite tables (audit_log, metrics_history, health_history, trades, strategy_registry).
  - **Strategy registry persistence:** `v003_strategies.py` migration creates `strategy_registry` table with 3 built-in seed strategies; `_sync_strategy_registry()` syncs in-memory registry to SQLite on startup.
  - **Config validation improvements:** Validates db_path directory exists, MAX_DRAWDOWN is 0-100 (not just >100), data_collection.forex_symbols is a list.
  - **Auto-purge on startup:** `_get_db()` calls `purge_old_entries()` after migrations.

### Changed
- **`Event` dataclass moved to `domain/ports.py`:** Shared value object used by both domain protocols and infrastructure implementations.
- **`InMemoryEventBus` implements `EventBusPort`** protocol (was separate ABC in infrastructure).
- **`HealthService` implements `HealthPort`** protocol, uses `HealthStatus` port type.
- **`AuditService` implements `AuditPort`** protocol, uses `AuditEntry` port type.
- **`MetricsService` implements `MetricsPort`** protocol, uses `MetricSample` port type.
- **`RunManifestService` implements `ManifestPort`** protocol, uses `ManifestEntry` port type.
- **`TradingOrchestrator` depends on port protocols** instead of concrete infrastructure classes.
- **Factory imports concrete implementations** as composition root; wire via protocol types.

## [0.7.0] - Sprint Finale: 15 Quick Wins
### Added
- **`--json` output flag on CLI:** `strategies`, `health`, `audit`, `signal` commands output structured JSON when `--json` is passed (GAP-19).
- **Health check in Dockerfile:** `HEALTHCHECK CMD traderos health || exit 1` enables Docker orchestration health monitoring (GAP-16).
- **CORS middleware in API:** FastAPI server allows cross-origin requests via `CORSMiddleware(allow_origins=["*"])` (GAP-17).
- **`/papertrade/session` market_ids body:** Accepts `CreatePaperSessionRequest` with optional `market_ids`; falls back to `settings.yaml` symbols (GAP-11).
- **Limit order support in Alpaca adapter:** `place_limit_order()` calls `trading_client.submit_order()` with `LimitOrderRequest` (GAP-21).
- **Notification persistence + webhook:** `_send_file()` writes JSONL to `logs/notifications.jsonl`; `_send_webhook()` POSTs to `$WEBHOOK_URL` (GAP-9).

### Fixed
- **`Config.load()` ignores `settings.yaml` nested keys:** 8 fields now translate from `settings.yaml` dotted keys (`database.path`→`db_path`, `logging.level`→`log_level`, etc.) (GAP-14).
- **Docker `MODE=paper` env var has no effect:** Removed `MODE` from both service definitions in `docker-compose.yml` (GAP-15).
- **Paper broker balance still hardcoded in `/v1/papertrade`:** `account_balance` reads `DEFAULT_CASH` env var with `10000.0` fallback (GAP-25).
- **`/metrics` panics when orchestrator not running:** Returns `{"warning": "Orchestrator not started"}`, removing 500 error (GAP-27).
- **Backtest can hang forever:** `BacktestingService.run()` accepts `max_duration_seconds=300` and raises `TimeoutError` with remaining-candle count (GAP-20).
- **Daemon can hang on shutdown:** `Orchestrator.run_forever()` forces exit after `shutdown_timeout=30` seconds (GAP-23).
- **EventBus handler crash kills broker:** `InMemoryEventBus.publish()` wraps each handler in try/except, logging and isolating exceptions (GAP-22).

### Removed
- **Strategy lab `run` subparser:** `strategy_lab.py` stripped to just `list` command; obsolete strategy-lab run path removed (GAP-7).

## [0.6.1] - Stale Module Cleanup & CLI Wiring
### Fixed
- **Hardcoded `close_price=100.0` in `run_forever()`:** Now fetches real data via `data_ingestion.get_latest_close()`; skips cycle and reports unhealthy when price unavailable instead of silently trading at $100.
- **5 stale domain module groups deleted:** `liquidity/` (5 files), `analysis/indicators.py`, `risk/engine.py`, `strategies/` (base_strategy.py + strategies.py), `backtesting/engine.py`. Test files updated to remove references; `strategy_lab.py` updated to use new `strategy_framework` registry.
- **`cmd_signal` no-op in CLI:** Now builds an orchestrator and displays active signals from `SignalService.get_active_signals()`. Market-specific or all-markets listing.
- **Paper trading cash hardcoded in 6 locations:** Consolidated to `Config.default_cash` field with `DEFAULT_CASH` env var fallback; `PaperBrokerAdapter.account_balance`, `PaperSession.initial_capital`/`current_capital`, `BacktestingService.initial_capital`, `TradingOrchestrator._cash_balance()` all read from config.
- **3 `assert` statements in production code:** `server.py:78`, `migration_manager.py:55`, `research_engine.py:67` replaced with proper `RuntimeError` + error context.
- **Version inconsistency (`0.2.0` vs `0.4.0` vs `0.6.0`):** `pyproject.toml` version set to `0.6.0`; server and CLI now read `importlib.metadata.version("traderos")` instead of hardcoded strings.
- **Stale `.env.example`:** Replaced with template including `DEFAULT_CASH`, `MODE`, `ALPACA_API_KEY`, `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY`, `ALPACA_PAPER`.

## [0.6.0] - Infrastructure Hardening & Pipeline Wiring
### Fixed
- **Container runs as root:** Added `USER traderos` directive to Dockerfile with dedicated system user/group.
- **SQLite concurrent access:** Enabled WAL journal mode + `busy_timeout=5000` + connection `timeout=10` in `DatabaseManager` for safe multi-container operation.
- **DB connections leaked:** Added `__enter__`/`__exit__` context manager to `DatabaseManager` for guaranteed cleanup.
- **All dependency versions unpinned:** `pyproject.toml` dependencies now use `==` pinning; 10 undeclared dependencies (numpy, pandas, PyYAML, python-dotenv, matplotlib, seaborn, tabulate, pydantic, fastapi, uvicorn, alpaca-py) added with pinned versions. `dev` optional-dependency group added for tooling.
- **Alpaca UUID→symbol bug:** `AlpacaBrokerAdapter` accepts `symbol_map` dict; factory builds mapping from `DataIngestionService` sources and passes it at construction. Runtime symbol resolution replaces broken `str(market_id)`.
- **AnalysisService dead code:** `TradingOrchestrator.run_cycle()` now fetches real candle data via `data_ingestion.fetch_candles()` and computes SMA/ATR via `AnalysisService` static methods. Fake indicators (`close*1.01`, `close*0.99`, `volume=1000`) replaced with computed values.
- **Dual collector implementations:** Removed old `infrastructure/data/collectors.py` and `infrastructure/data/pipeline.py`; single `infrastructure/collectors/` hierarchy (DataCollector ABC) is the sole data collector path. Eliminates `ccxt` and `yfinance` import dependencies.
- **`fail_under` raised to 70:** Previous sprint set to 70 (was 30); now 514 tests pass at 76% coverage.

## [0.5.0] - Blocker Clearance & Architecture Cleanup
### Fixed
- **Docker build broken:** `.dockerignore` no longer excludes `pyproject.toml`; build succeeds again.
- **`fail_under = 30`:** Raised to 70 to prevent coverage regression masking.
- **`Config.load()` `or` truthiness bug:** Falsy env vars (`""`, `"0"`) no longer silently skipped to YAML defaults.
- **`Config.validate()` dead code:** Now called at end of `Config.load()`.
- **3 competing DB path defaults:** Consolidated to `config.db_path` as single canonical source.
- **Slippage direction bug:** `PaperBrokerAdapter` now uses `1 - bps/10000` for sells (was always `1 + bps`, giving sells better-than-market price).
- **Backtest equity bug:** `BacktestingService.run()` tracks cash separately from position value; equity = cash + position_qty × close (was using constant initial_capital, producing phantom profits).
- **Old signals re-processed:** `TradingOrchestrator.run_cycle()` processes only the newly generated signal instead of all active signals.
- **`FillResult` name collision:** `execution_service.FillResult` renamed to `ExecutionFillResult` (different `status` types: `str` vs `OrderStatus`).
- **`assert` in alpaca_broker.py:** Replaced with proper conditional checks (assert disabled by `-O` flag).
- **`assert` in research_engine.py:** 4 instances replaced with `if cursor.lastrowid is None: raise RuntimeError(...)`.
- **Hardcoded $10,000 cash:** `TradingOrchestrator` uses `_cash_balance()` which returns broker balance in LIVE mode, configurable default otherwise.

### Added
- **CI pipeline:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — 4-job pipeline (lint → typecheck → test → docker) with concurrency grouping and caching.
- **`DatabasePort` protocol:** `domain/ports.py` breaks dependency rule violation; 5 domain classes no longer import `DatabaseManager` from infrastructure.
- **Missing `__init__.py`:** `infrastructure/logging/`, `infrastructure/repositories/` now have proper package init files.
- **SPRINT_5.md** documents the blocker clearance sprint.

### Removed
- **10 stale flat module directories:** `analysis_engine/`, `backtesting/`, `correlation_engine/`, `data_pipeline/`, `database/`, `journal_engine/`, `liquidity_engine/`, `risk_engine/`, `strategy_lab/`, `visualization/` deleted.
- **4 root-level scripts:** `main.py`, `dashboard_cli.py`, `research_cli.py`, `strategy_lab_cli.py` deleted (replaced by `traderos` entry point).
- **`infrastructure/logging.py`:** Content moved to `infrastructure/logging/__init__.py`.

### Verification
- **Lint:** 0 ruff errors
- **Typecheck:** 0 pyright errors
- **Tests:** 514 passed, coverage 75% (threshold 70%)
- **Assessment score improved:** 4.3 → 5.5 weighted

## [0.4.0] - Real-Market Wiring: Data Feed, Broker, Price Integrity
### Fixed
- **fill_price multiplier bug (Gap 3):** `PaperBrokerAdapter.place_market_order()` now returns absolute price (`close_price * slippage`) instead of just the slippage multiplier. `BrokerAdapter` ABC accepts optional `close_price` parameter. `PaperTradingService.process_candle()` no longer double-multiplies. `TradingOrchestrator.run_cycle()` passes `close_price` to broker for accurate trade records.
- **Daemon panic recovery:** `run_forever()` wraps `run_cycle()` in try/except; per-cycle errors are logged and reported to health service without crashing the daemon.

### Added
- **Real market data feed (Gap 1):** `DataIngestionService.get_latest_close(market_id)` resolves latest close price from configured collectors. Factory builds `CollectorRegistry` with `MockDataCollector` + optional `BinanceCollector`. Symbols parsed from `settings.yaml` (`data_collection.forex_symbols` + `crypto_symbols`) generate deterministic market IDs. `run_forever()` reads real prices instead of hardcoded `100.0`.
- **Alpaca broker for LIVE mode (Gap 2):** Factory branches broker selection on `TradingMode.LIVE` — uses `AlpacaBrokerAdapter` when `alpaca_api_key` + `alpaca_secret_key` are configured; falls back to `PaperBrokerAdapter` gracefully. Config typed fields `alpaca_api_key`, `alpaca_secret_key`, `alpaca_paper` with `ALPACA_API_KEY`/`ALPACA_SECRET_KEY`/`ALPACA_PAPER` env var support.
- **SPRINT_4.md** documents the sprint.

- **5 tests pass.**
- **`BacktestStep` NamedTuple** captures per-bar equity, order, and fill price for granular analysis.

### WP-008: Namespace Package Restructuring
- **New layered structure under `src/traderos/`:**
  - `domain/` — `analysis/`, `liquidity/`, `risk/`, `strategies/`, `backtesting/`, `research/`
  - `infrastructure/` — `config/`, `database/`, `data/`
  - `application/` — `orchestrator.py`
  - `interfaces/` — `cli/`, `visualization/`
- **Dual directory strategy:** Old flat modules (`analysis_engine/`, `database/`, etc.) become re-export shims preserving backward compatibility.
- **All internal imports updated** to `traderos.domain.*`, `traderos.infrastructure.*`, `traderos.application.*`, `traderos.interfaces.*`.
- **Tooling configs updated:** pyproject.toml (pyright extraPaths, coverage source), Makefile (PYTHONPATH=src), Dockerfile (ENV PYTHONPATH), CI workflow.
- **Entry point scripts** (`main.py`, `dashboard_cli.py`, `research_cli.py`, `strategy_lab_cli.py`) become thin wrappers that add `src` to path and delegate to new structure.

### AI Engineering Operating System
